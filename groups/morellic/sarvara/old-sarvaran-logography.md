## Overview
The old Sarvaran logography was a writing system invented by the Sarvarans in the early Bronze Age, after the [Morellic migration](groups/morellic/morellic-migration*.md) when the Mora were beginning to settle in the Sarvaran river basin, forming their feudal society and constructing permanent settlements and farms at the banks of the river Sarav.

The logography was carved into wood or bark, mostly on the branches or trunks of [Dhajar](flora/dhajar.md) or [Asaran](flora/asaran.md) trees.
