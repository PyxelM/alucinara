Sayä is a plant of the equatorial rainforest of the [2nd-realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md) which features small pink flowers.

## Predators
The Flowers are sought after by Minikin, Demislugs, and small rodents due to their high concentration of nutrients.

The flowers are ground down and boiled in a pot, and are inedible unless cooked to Demislugs.
