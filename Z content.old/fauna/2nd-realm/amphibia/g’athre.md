G’athre are small poisonous amphibians of the equatorial rainforest of the [2nd realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md).

## Morphology
They are tetrapodal, exhibit fortuitary glands, and have 4 "nostrils" on each side of their spine, totalling 8.

### Nostrils
These 8 nostrils aren't used for breathing, however. Strong muscles lining the orifices allow them to be opened and closed, similar to seals' ability to shut their nose when underwater.

The nostrils, technically "Toxiphores," release poisonous gas when the animal is threatened. The high Alucinarium content within it may cause [phantasmarrhoea](private/Z%20content.old/illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md) in high doses, but usually the victim will only experience hallucinations from the substance before they die from the other compounds within the gas.

### Legs
Their hind legs are 2 times as long as their front legs, but fold into a more comfortable position when sitting. These legs are used to escape prey.
