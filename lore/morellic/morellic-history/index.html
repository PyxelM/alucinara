<a href=/species/fauna/minikin/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/minikin/>minikin</a> is long, beginning with the M√≥ra tribe.</p><a href=#the-m√≥ra-tribe><h2 id=the-m√≥ra-tribe><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The M√≥ra Tribe</h2></a><p>The M√≥ra were a tribe of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern
<a href=/lore/locations/tseireph/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/lore/locations/tseireph/>Tseir√©ph</a>, subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.</p><p>By their peak, the M√≥ra held 6 clans of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these clans was the S√©nna, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.</p><a href=#the-s√©nna-clan><h2 id=the-s√©nna-clan><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The S√©nna Clan</h2></a><p>The S√©nna, led by a matriarch known as D√≠rw√Ædh, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.</p><p>The largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the M√≥ra; a city known as End√°ir≈≥, meaning &lsquo;city of farms,&rsquo; built upon the annually-flooding river √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s, meaning &lsquo;river of the east,&rsquo; in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.</p><a href=#the-s√©nna-civil-war><h2 id=the-s√©nna-civil-war><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The S√©nna Civil War</h2></a><p>The stability of the S√©nna was thrown into question, however, upon the civil war. Triggered by a succession crisis between D√≠rw√Ædh&rsquo;s daughters, the elder Hw√©rna and the younger M√≥th, which ended in the latter&rsquo;s assassination, a new clan split off; the Lant√°na.</p><a href=#the-battle-over-the-√∫r≈≥c√°s><h2 id=the-battle-over-the-√∫r≈≥c√°s><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Battle over the √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s</h2></a><p>The Lant√°na, led by D√≠rw√Ædh&rsquo;s eldest niece W√≠rridh, fought with the S√©nna, led by Hw√©rna, over matriarchal power. This led to the Battle of √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s. The S√©nna were flanked from the west by the Lant√°na military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.</p><p>The battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of S√©nna minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lant√°na victorious, the S√©nna were defeated, but the battle left End√°ir≈≥ inhospitable, run-down, and littered with
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Baby Meadows</a>.</p><a href=#proliferation-of-the-northeast><h2 id=proliferation-of-the-northeast><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Proliferation of the Northeast</h2></a><p>While the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lant√°na&rsquo;s part.</p><p>Having received prophecy of a famine, W√≠rridh made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lant√°na and S√©nna, to the
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Petrified Child</a> so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.</p><p>This was a success, initially; the Lant√°na built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of End√°ir≈≥ to the west, known as End√°ir≈≥ m√∫Kref√≠r, meaning &lsquo;New End√°ir≈≥.&rsquo; There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other M√≥ra clans moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.</p><p>In addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the M√≥ra minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Oyh√≥l√Øru.</p><a href=#the-famine><h2 id=the-famine><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Famine</h2></a><p>Despite the Lant√°na&rsquo;s efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=deities/mother-tree>The Mother Tree</a> to punish the Lant√°na for preparing with such violence.</p><p>The total population of the M√≥ra halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. New End√°ir≈≥ became known as √Ånnakh√°ir≈≥, meaning &rsquo;the city of souls.&rsquo;</p><p>The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving S√©nna minikin attempted to take over the Lant√°na once more.</p><a href=#ankewenith-and-the-we√°ha><h2 id=ankewenith-and-the-we√°ha><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ankewenith and the We&rsquo;√°ha</h2></a><p>Following the loss over the √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s, the surviving S√©nna, known as the Ankewenith, fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lant√°na and sympathetic M√≥ra in the neighbouring nation of the We&rsquo;√°ha tribe to the west.</p><p>Motivated by racism and jealousy, the We&rsquo;√°ha, led by the patriarch Urubr√©√§ and his vizier Urw√°na (Hw√©rna&rsquo;s daughter, the new Ankewenith matriarch), passed east over the river K√≥hosh against the Lant√°na.</p><a href=#the-weakening-of-the-lant√°na><h2 id=the-weakening-of-the-lant√°na><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Weakening of the Lant√°na</h2></a><p>The We&rsquo;√°ha didn&rsquo;t take to raiding cities such as √Ånnakh√°ir≈≥, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lant√°na&rsquo;s territory. These settlements were the nation&rsquo;s main source of food, especially those built on the √ör≈≥Ãàc√°s.</p><p>The We&rsquo;√°ha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lant√°na farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lant√°na, and made them dependent on the hostile We&rsquo;√°ha for the little food in the area left.</p><a href=#urw√°nas-plans><h2 id=urw√°nas-plans><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Urw√°na&rsquo;s Plans</h2></a><p>Unbeknownst to Urubr√©√§, his vizier Urw√°na was rounding the S√©nna and their mercenaries against the Lant√°na, with the intent to attack √Ånnakh√°ir≈≥ and genocide the Lant√°na in their weakened state.</p><p>While the We&rsquo;√°ha were concerned with oppressing and virtually enslaving the Lant√°na, the S√©nna were concerned with complete annihilation - a prospect unappealing to the We&rsquo;√°ha.</p><p>This was discovered by the Lant√°na-sympathetic supreme priest of the We&rsquo;√°ha, Rw√©nedh the Blind, whom was 1 quarter Lant√°na. He, in secret, told the Lant√°na matriarch W√≠rridh II (daughter of the previous) of the S√©nna&rsquo;s plans.</p><a href=#lant√°na-oyh√≥l√Øru-league><h2 id=lant√°na-oyh√≥l√Øru-league><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lant√°na-Oyh√≥l√Øru League</h2></a><p>Upon hearing of this, the Lant√°na proposed a military alliance with the Oyh√≥l√Øru in order to fight the S√©nna upon the dawn of their genocidal campaign, which was accepted.</p><p>Letting the S√©nna continue in their plans, they waited for a direct attack, while massing an army of Oyh√≥l√Øru soldiers and Lant√°na commanders. While the famine was chipping away at the Lant√°na, the Oyh√≥l√Øru territory was still abundant in food, allowing the S√©nna to remain.</p><a href=#seige-of-√°nnakh√°ir≈≥><h2 id=seige-of-√°nnakh√°ir≈≥><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Seige of √Ånnakh√°ir≈≥</h2></a><p>This direct attack came in the Siege of √Ånnakh√°ir≈≥. Blindsided, the We&rsquo;√°ha provided no support, and in fact executed every S√©nna official in power. Urw√°na and her generals were the only S√©nna nobles in power at this point, but their fiery hatred proved them unaffected by the response to their betrayal.</p><p>In the battle, the walls were broken down and trade routes disrupted. The League was able to hold off the S√©nna for a while, but the Lant√°na eventually surrendered and fled the city in search of refuge.</p><a href=#migration-of-the-lant√°na><h2 id=migration-of-the-lant√°na><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Migration of the Lant√°na</h2></a><p>Following the surrender of the Lant√°na, a vast portion of their men were taken as slaves by the S√©nna. The rest resolved to travel south, returning to the nomadic lifestyle they had left behind in End√°ir≈≥.</p><p>The most of the men left were the disabled, those unworthy of labour, all of whom were euthanized as the Lant√°na began to travel. Some were cannibalised to maximise food during the famine, which led to many retaliations from the
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Petrified Child</a>.</p><a href=#arrival-at-the-lakes><h2 id=arrival-at-the-lakes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arrival at the Lakes</h2></a><p>Travelling from the steppe through the deserts, living as nomads, the tribe reached the equatorial saltwater lakes and the surrounding rain-forests.</p><p>They felt this was an opportune time to settle down once more, as the lakes provided a pseudo-maritime role reminiscent of End√°ir≈≥. The largest city to emerge at the shore of the largest of these lakes was √Åurukw√°ir≈≥.</p><p>By this point, the famine had subsided, and the clan had grown. Now their Proto-Morellic language had developed into Old Sarvaran, and genetic diversity had increased.
