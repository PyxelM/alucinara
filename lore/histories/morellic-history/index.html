<a href=/species/fauna/minikin/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/minikin/>minikin</a> is long, beginning with the Mora tribe.</p><a href=#the-mora-race><h2 id=the-mora-race><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Mora Race</h2></a><p>The Mora were a race of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern
<a href=/lore/locations/tseireph/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/lore/locations/tseireph/>Tseir√©ph</a>, subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.</p><p>By their peak, the Mora held 6 tribes of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these tribes was the Sewi, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.</p><a href=#the-sewi-tribe><h2 id=the-sewi-tribe><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Sewi Tribe</h2></a><p>The Sewi, led by a matriarch known as Dilv√Ædh, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.</p><p>The largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the Mora; a city known as End√Ærun, meaning &lsquo;city of farms,&rsquo; built upon the annually-flooding river Er√ºc√¢s, meaning &lsquo;river of the east,&rsquo; in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.</p><a href=#the-sewi-civil-war><h2 id=the-sewi-civil-war><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Sewi Civil War</h2></a><p>However, the stability of the Sewi was thrown into question upon Dilv√Ædh&rsquo;s death. Her eldest, the disabled matriarch Viga, was assassinated by the command of her sibling Ferna, who thought that she was better suited to rule.</p><p>This led to a bloody civil war, causing the decimation of the Sewi population. Two tribes split off; the Lant√¢na, led by Dilv√Ædh&rsquo;s now eldest, W√≠rildh, and the Djer√¢ya, led by Ferna. The two began to fight for matriarchal power over the Sewi.</p><a href=#the-battle-over-the-er√ºc√¢s><h3 id=the-battle-over-the-er√ºc√¢s><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Battle over the Er√ºc√¢s</h3></a><p>In a battle fought over the river Er√ºc√¢s, the Djer√¢ya were flanked from the west by the Lant√¢na military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.</p><p>The battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of Djer√¢ya minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lant√¢na victorious, the Djer√¢ya were defeated, but the battle left End√Ærun inhospitable, run-down, and littered with
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Baby Meadows</a>.</p><a href=#proliferation-of-the-northeast><h2 id=proliferation-of-the-northeast><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Proliferation of the Northeast</h2></a><p>While the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river Er√ºc√¢s caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lant√¢na&rsquo;s part.</p><p>Having received prophecy of a famine, W√≠rildh made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lant√¢na and Djer√¢ya, to the
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Petrified Child</a> so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.</p><p>This was a success, initially; the Lant√¢na built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of End√Ærun to the west, known as New End√Ærun. There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other Mora tribes moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.</p><p>In addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the Mora minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Hany√¢r√Ø.</p><a href=#the-famine><h3 id=the-famine><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Famine</h3></a><p>Despite the Lant√¢na&rsquo;s efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=deities/mother-tree>The Mother Tree</a> to punish the Lant√¢na for preparing with such violence.</p><p>The total population of the Mora halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving Djer√¢ya minikin attempted to take over the Lant√¢na once more.</p><a href=#the-yuaha><h2 id=the-yuaha><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Yu&rsquo;aha</h2></a><p>Following the loss over the Er√ºc√¢s, the surviving Djer√¢ya fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lant√¢na and sympathetic Mora in the neighbouring nation of the Yu&rsquo;aha tribe to the west.</p><p>Motivated by racism and jealousy, the Yu&rsquo;aha, led by the patriarch Ero&rsquo;u and his vizier Ar√™ven (Ferna&rsquo;s grand-daughter, the new Djer√¢ya matriarch), passed east over the river Koyhots against the Lant√¢na.</p><a href=#the-weakening-of-the-lant√¢na><h3 id=the-weakening-of-the-lant√¢na><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Weakening of the Lant√¢na</h3></a><p>The Yu&rsquo;aha didn&rsquo;t take to raiding cities such as New End√Ærun, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lant√¢na&rsquo;s territory. These settlements were the nation&rsquo;s main source of food, especially those built on the Er√ºc√¢s.</p><p>The Yu&rsquo;aha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lant√¢na farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lant√¢na, and made them dependent on the hostile Yu&rsquo;aha for the little food in the area left.</p><a href=#ar√™vens-plans><h3 id=ar√™vens-plans><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ar√™ven&rsquo;s Plans</h3></a><p>Unbeknownst to Ero&rsquo;u, his vizier Ar√™ven was rounding the Djer√¢ya and their mercenaries against the Lant√¢na, with the intent to attack New End√Ærun and genocide the Lant√¢na in their weakened state.</p><p>While the Yu&rsquo;aha were concerned with oppressing and virtually enslaving the Lant√¢na, the Djer√¢ya were concerned with complete annihilation - a prospect unappealing to the Yu&rsquo;aha.</p><p>This was discovered by the Lant√¢na-sympathetic supreme priest of the Yu&rsquo;aha, Rwenedh the Blind, whom was 1 quarter Lant√¢na. He, in secret, told the Lant√¢na matriarch Viga II (grand-daughter of Wir√Ældh) of the Djer√¢ya&rsquo;s plans.</p><a href=#lant√¢na-hany√¢r√Ø-league><h3 id=lant√¢na-hany√¢r√Ø-league><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lant√¢na-Hany√¢r√Ø League</h3></a><p>Upon hearing of this, the Lant√¢na proposed a military alliance with the Hany√¢r√Ø in order to fight the Djer√¢ya upon the dawn of their genocidal campaign, which was accepted.</p><p>Letting the Djer√¢ya continue in their plans, they waited for a direct attack, while massing an army of Hany√¢r√Ø soldiers and Lant√¢na commanders. While the famine was chipping away at the Lant√¢na, the Hany√¢r√Ø territory was still abundant in food, allowing the Djer√¢ya to remain.</p><a href=#seige-of-new-end√Ærun><h3 id=seige-of-new-end√Ærun><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Seige of New End√Ærun</h3></a><p>This direct attack came in the Siege of New End√Ærun. Blindsided, the Yu&rsquo;aha provided no support, and in fact executed every Djer√¢ya official in power. Ar√™ven and her generals were the only Djer√¢ya nobles in power at this point, but their fiery hatred proved them unaffected by the response to their betrayal.</p><p>In the battle, the walls were broken down and trade routes disrupted. The League was able to hold off the Djer√¢ya for a while, but the Lant√¢na eventually surrendered and fled the city in search of refuge.</p><a href=#migration-of-the-lant√¢na><h2 id=migration-of-the-lant√¢na><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Migration of the Lant√¢na</h2></a><p>Following the surrender of the Lant√¢na, a vast portion of their men were taken as slaves by the Djer√¢ya. The rest resolved to travel south, returning to the nomadic lifestyle they had left behind in End√Ærun.</p><p>The most of the men left were the disabled, those unworthy of labour, all of whom were euthanized as the Lant√¢na began to travel. Some were cannibalised to maximise food during the famine, which led to many retaliations from the
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>Petrified Child</a>.</p><a href=#arrival-at-the-lakes><h3 id=arrival-at-the-lakes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arrival at the Lakes</h3></a><p>Travelling from the steppe through the deserts, living as nomads, the tribe reached the equatorial saltwater lakes and the surrounding rainforests, now led by the matriarch Sour√©l (grand-daughter of Viga II.)</p><a href=#geography><h4 id=geography><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Geography</h4></a><p>There were two lakes that divided the north of

The Kast√©irra were divided into 3 main tribes, the N√©th to the south, Vel√°ni to the north, and K√Ærl√©gh in the southeastern inner corner of the lake.</p><p>The Eastern Lake, known as Angh√¥l√Ø, was home to the UruÃãnnu race of minikin. The UruÃãnnu was made up of the K√°uneph to the south and the Hany√¢r√Ø to the north - a group the Lant√¢na had already met.</p><a href=#dispersion-into-nearby-areas><h3 id=dispersion-into-nearby-areas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dispersion into Nearby areas</h3></a><p>The Lant√¢na felt this was an opportune time to settle down once more, as the lakes provided a pseudo-maritime role reminiscent of the End√Ærunic coasts. The largest Lant√¢na settlement built after the migration was known as N√°iruÃ®, a port city on the inner southeastern corner of the lake Angh√¥l√Ø.</p><p>The Lant√¢na were largely peaceful with the natives, respecting their borders and customs, creating a healthy economic relationship.</p><a href=#the-auruk><h2 id=the-auruk><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The AuruÃãk</h2></a><p>Following years of cohabitation, some Lant√¢na and K√Ærl√©gh Kast√©irra hybridised, forming the new AuruÃãk tribe at their border, although some Kast√©irra and Lant√¢na groups further from the border did not hybridise, and rather retained their earlier culture. The first AuruÃãk matriarch was known as M«´ÃÅth (Sour√©l&rsquo;s daughter.)</p><a href=#appearance><h4 id=appearance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Appearance</h4></a><p>The AuruÃãk were defined by their brown skin, bristly hair, and the fur that grew from their hands, feet, and extremities, resembling the Kast√©irra minikin as well as the Mora.</p><a href=#language><h4 id=language><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Language</h4></a><p>The Lant√¢na began to speak Old Sarvaran, a language developed from Proto-Morellic. The AuruÃãk dialect of Old Sarvaran developed into a pidgin, and eventually the AuruÃãk creole, influenced by the K√Ærl√©gh superstrate dialect.</p><a href=#religion><h4 id=religion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Religion</h4></a><p>Having picked up many cultural practices throughout the Lant√¢na migration and merging with the Kast√©irra, they also developed their own

This led to the creation of many Baby Meadows, which increased soil fertility, and thus the establishment of many farming towns.</p><p>Due to the volatile position of these towns, many guard posts were constructed in the canopy of the surrounding rainforest, on trees and guard towers. Due to the increased pressure from the Vel√°ni, many advancements were made.</p><a href=#advancements-in-defence-and-offence><h3 id=advancements-in-defence-and-offence><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Advancements in Defence and Offence</h3></a><p>Some innovations were made in the field of archery and cavalry.</p><p>While minikin had previously hunted and battled by hurling pointy objects at each other through
<a href=/phenomena/alucinara/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/alucinara/>alucinara</a>, the AuruÃãk began to create specialised arrows. Arrows would be blessed with
<a href=/phenomena/symbols/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/symbols/>symbols</a> to create a certain effect, could now be kept within a quiver, and more than one could be shot at once.</p><p>In addition, they began to train some native mustelids known as War Weasels into aiding in battle. These War Weasels would learn to stay calm during a fight, and pay attention to cues from their rider into performing tactical movements, evasion, and war dances. Some war weasels would be blessed with symbolic brands.</p><a href=#vel√°ni-war><h2 id=vel√°ni-war><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vel√°ni War</h2></a><a href=#aftermath><h3 id=aftermath><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Aftermath</h3></a><a href=#founding-of-sarvara-etc><h2 id=founding-of-sarvara-etc><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Founding of Sarvara, etc.</h2></a><p>sarvara was south east of the lakes, neth was directly on them, and kaseirra was a hybrid of the kaseirrith and morellic minikin, to the east on the coast of the sarvaran gulf, to the north of sarvara.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/lore/creation-story/ data-ctx="The History of the Morellic Minikin" data-src=/lore/creation-story class=internal-link>The Creation Story</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://book.pyxelm.xyz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Mylo Hodges using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2024</p><ul><li><a href=https://book.pyxelm.xyz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pyxelm.xyz/>Website</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-83oShBjl-0oR57dzvza2g>Youtube</a></li><li><a href=https://pyxelm.bandcamp.com>Bandcamp</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pyxelm/alucinara>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
