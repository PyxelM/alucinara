The material of the void was Darkness, a pitch-black substance made of hydrocarbons. There were two consciousnesses in the void, the first Judge and the second, who existed to create the universe.</p><p>The first judge helmed the operation, designing the
<a href=/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws/>laws of nature</a> and giving the green light to the second judge&rsquo;s every suggestion. Together, they cleared the void of darkness, designed planets, stars, elements, and each their roles in the universe.</p><p>Stars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a fast steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which predestined the universe to appear as an art piece. Beautiful, ornamental, and not meant for living inhabitants.</p><a href=#life><h3 id=life><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Life</h3></a><p>However, the second judge began to deviate from the first&rsquo;s plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of their own; <em>life</em>. Life was created in the form of the Darklings - creatures made of darkness, hidden from light so that they would not be discovered.</p><p>The darklings immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the natural laws not built for them. They built empires founded on the backs of planets, and sucked the light out of stars for energy, so that the darkness could spread, and so that they could continue to go undiscovered.</p><a href=#darklings-mistake><h3 id=darklings-mistake><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Darklings&rsquo; Mistake</h3></a><p>Eventually, the darklings grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the first judge once the last star was gone. The first judge was furious when it had discovered them, disgusted and mortified that matter could move and take reality for its own interests, never to aid nature.</p><p>In an apocalyptic turn of events, the first judge shattered the walls of reality as it tried in vain to push off the darklings, and it was unfortunately subsumed by the mass of living darkness.</p><a href=#aftermath><h2 id=aftermath><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Aftermath</h2></a><p>Almost immediately, the second judge created the
<a href=/phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws/>second laws of nature</a> in a last-ditch attempt to save its companion, but it was too late, and only served to worsen the shattered new reality. In the first judge&rsquo;s last moments, it turned itself
<a href=/phenomena/alucinara/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/alucinara/>alucinara</a>, an infinite form of energy that would allow the first laws to live on within the second laws, allowing its legacy to continue.</p><a href=#the-darklings><h3 id=the-darklings><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Darklings</h3></a><p>It also banished the darklings to the void-space that surrounded every small bubble of reality left. It defined their place in the universe, that they would never be able to destroy the world unfettered once more. Without alucinara energy, that would bring the first laws of nature back into effect, the darklings would be rendered a simple tar - with no thoughts and no intentions, a product of the second laws.</p><p>The first judge resolved to turn their existence into some good - it had created the <em>soul</em>.</p><a href=#the-soul><h3 id=the-soul><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Soul</h3></a><p>The Darklings were then turned into Souls, which are Darkness under effects of Alucinara. It was created so that the darklings could only touch reality by fuelling the good of an innocent creature, and could never do anything without the limits of a biochemical host.</p><p>The soul could only manifest as amino acids, or other organic compounds such as tar, when in contact with alucinara. This is what gives organisms such as animals and plants life - the amino acids in their bodies interacts with aluicnara to create thought and intention.</p><p>Without alucinara, darklings would only appear as organic compounds <em>without</em> the capacity for thought, as the second laws of nature weren&rsquo;t built to perpetuate the soul. They often appear as the natural substance tar, being given their own place in the universe such as in tar pits and resin.</p><a href=#the-realms><h3 id=the-realms><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Realms</h3></a><p>In the universe&rsquo;s final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more succeptible to the effects of the
<a href=/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws/>first laws</a>.</p><p>One could shift from realm to realm by creating
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=phenomena/alucinara-gateway>alucinara gateways</a>, the process getting more alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.</p><a href=#heirarchy-of-beings><h2 id=heirarchy-of-beings><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Heirarchy of Beings</h2></a><p>In the new realms, things began to settle. The threat of further shattering decreased to zero, and stars began to flare once more into eternal brightness. New things began to be created, as well, things that were impossible under the old laws.</p><a href=#planets><h3 id=planets><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Planets</h3></a><p>For example, planets formed into largely static mounds of dust and minerals. Given enough tar were present in one, and given enough alucinara energy was nearby, a soul could be formed within. One such soul was
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=deities/qerhel>Qerhel</a>, who resided within the planet of the same name, within the 2nd realm.</p><a href=#mountains-and-oceans><h3 id=mountains-and-oceans><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mountains and Oceans</h3></a><p>In addition, a soul could divide and its new children could take a smaller, more specified, element of their parent as a host. The two elements that a child could take a hold of were the land and sea, each child soul residing within one or more mountains or oceans.</p><a href=#biomes><h3 id=biomes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Biomes</h3></a><p>Further division could occur, and the ways for a soul to manifest became larger. An ocean soul could divide into a coral reef, an abyss, or a kelp forest. Likewise, a mountain soul could divide into a land forest, a desert, or another biome. In some cases, a mountain soul could even divide into a creature capable of movement.</p><a href=#higher-order-creatures><h3 id=higher-order-creatures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Higher-Order Creatures</h3></a><p>For example, a creature formed from a mountain is
<a href=/deities/the-petrified-child/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/deities/the-petrified-child/>The Petrified Child</a>, which is made of a large, floating, alucinarium geode. It is externally visible as a rock with the face of a child, and became revered as a deity in many
<a href=/species/fauna/minikin/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/minikin/>minikin</a> cultures.</p><p>Creatures formed from mountains are known as higher-order creatures, to distinguish them from lower-order creatures such as animals and nonliving phenomena such as
<a href=/phenomena/cloud-gnats/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/cloud-gnats/>cloud gnats</a>.</p><a href=#lower-order-creatures><h3 id=lower-order-creatures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lower-Order Creatures</h3></a><p>Lower order creatures, formed from the biomes, are animals such as ruminants, birds, reptiles, or minikin, et cetera. They are the most common of the souls, as they are able to create new physical bodies with the process of reproduction; this is a very effective stategy, due to the short lifespans of their physical bodies and likelyhood of disability compared to other souls.</p><p>Some lower-order creatures can live for very long, however, especially when aided with the help of alucinara energy. Some even make use of alucinara with help of the fortuitary gland, although this is rare in the 0th and nearby realms.</p><p>Humans are the most common creature in the 0th realm,
<a href=/species/fauna/demi-slugs/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/demi-slugs/>Demi-Slugs</a> the most common in the 1st,
<a href=/species/fauna/dragons/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/dragons/>Dragons</a> the most common in the -1st,
<a href=/species/fauna/minikin/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/minikin/>Minikin</a> the most common in the 2nd,
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=species/fauna/quartz-mice>Quartz Mice</a> the most common in the -2nd,
<a href=/species/flora/botanists/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/flora/botanists/>Botanists</a> the most common in the 3rd, and
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=species/fauna/wormwolves>Wormwolves</a> the most common in the -3rd.</p><a href=#nonliving-phenomena><h3 id=nonliving-phenomena><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nonliving Phenomena</h3></a><p>Nonliving phenomena are the result of alucinara interacting with matter without the presence of a soul. When alucinara is used in a soul, the patterns that come with being an animal are drilled into the energy like muscle memory, leading to the
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle>Pseudo Fauna Principle</a>.</p><p>When alucinara interacts with nonliving matter with the principle in effect, it will cause the matter to act as if it were an animal, attempting to fight, eat, and drink, all with no benefit. Some nonliving phenomena are commonplace, such as
<a href=/phenomena/cloud-gnats/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/cloud-gnats/>cloud gnats</a>,
<a href=/phenomena/watchstones/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/watchstones/>watchstones</a>, or
<a href=/phenomena/sky-islands/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/phenomena/sky-islands/>sky islands</a>.</p><a href=#species-of-the-realms><h2 id=species-of-the-realms><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Species of the Realms</h2></a><p>In every realm, many many species had developed. The specieses of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with alucinara energy. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.</p><a href=#the-supernova-of-80mb><h3 id=the-supernova-of-80mb><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Supernova of 80MB</h3></a><p>In 80MB<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, the shockwave of a far-off supernova had finally reached the Earth. The star that had caused it was extremely old, having retained a lot of alucinara from the energy left over from the shattering of the realms.</p><p>There was virtually no destruction on that day, but the main outcome was mass-frequencial shift of the animals and plants affected. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into different realms. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.</p><a href=#new-species><h3 id=new-species><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>New Species</h3></a><ul><li><a href=/species/fauna/demi-slugs/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/demi-slugs/>The Demi-Slugs</a></li><li><a href=/species/fauna/minikin/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/fauna/minikin/>The Minikin</a></li><li><a href=/species/flora/botanists/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/species/flora/botanists/>The Botanists</a></li></ul><a href=#the-history-of-the-2nd-realm><h2 id=the-history-of-the-2nd-realm><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The History of the 2nd Realm</h2></a><a href=#the-móra-riséwi-minikin><h3 id=the-móra-riséwi-minikin><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Móra riSéwi Minikin</h3></a><p>The Móra riSéwi (*moza li-sevi, or &lsquo;Children of the Forest&rsquo;) minikin were a nomadic tribe from around the time of Nairu. Their name means &lsquo;Children of Mora,&rsquo; the deity of the forest in the Morellic pantheon.</p><p>Their cultural traditions and way of life was that of never settling down unless they were under extreme circumstances, continually moving from place to place in search of food, resources, and treasure.</p><p>They would set up campsites, generally in trees, but also in bushes for its strategic advantage in areas inhabited by territorial natives. They would sleep in natural dens in trees, but also set up hammocks made out of leaves and fabric.</p><a href=#communities><h4 id=communities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Communities</h4></a><p>Mora riSewi communities were made up of an extended family, this could range from 50 related individuals to 500 related individuals.</p><p>These communities would share food with eachother, share resources, all sleep in one camp together when night came, and would all work together to achieve their common goals as a group.</p><a href=#government><h4 id=government><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government</h4></a><p>The government of Mora riSewi communities was that of a matriarchy, as with a lot of minikin tribes. The oldest and wisest woman would be appointed to lead a group, and power would be divested matrilineally to her eldest daughter upon her death.</p><p>It was the matriarch&rsquo;s responsibility to keep order within her community, while also leading her group on expeditions for food, resources, or treasure.</p><p>When not actively moving, the matriarch would be teaching the children of the group good morals and how to survive effectvely, she would give her own eldest daughter special treatment due to her importance to the future of the group.</p><a href=#the-oyholıru-minikin><h3 id=the-oyholıru-minikin><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Oyhólıru Minikin</h3></a><p>The Oyhólıru (*o-yhólıru, or &lsquo;People&rsquo;) minikin were a tribe native to the Nairuan peninsula and surrounding area, and were well known for their societal and industrial efficiency.</p><p>They were one of the first tribes to crack the code of agriculture, settling down and building the first permanent settlements in the 2nd realm once sowing and harvesting had a greater net reward in comparison to foraging.</p><a href=#nairu><h4 id=nairu><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nairu</h4></a><p>The greatest city-state of the Oyhólıru was Nairu (*na-ïru, or, &lsquo;The Farm&rsquo;), which was situated on the western shore of the Nairuan peninsula, just above the equator on the Natswh&rsquo;ara (*na-tswh&rsquo;kara, or &lsquo;The River&rsquo;) river. In the midst of the river&rsquo;s basin, the city was instrumental in the development of agriculture.</p><p>Nairu was known for its markets and farms, with tents strung up on the floor around the perimeter of tree trunks, shelters built out of twigs and leaves into the crotches of trees, and wide far-spanning farms of berries and herbs along the shore of the Natswh&rsquo;kara.</p><a href=#government-1><h4 id=government-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government</h4></a><p>The government of Nairu was headed by matriarchal queen, where power was divested matrilineally.

As they reached the edge of a steppe, they found a forest.</p><p>Foraging for food in the forest as they and their ancestors had done for hundreds of years, they went further deep, eventually stumbling upon a clearing, which featured a circular swamp in its midst with a tree in the centre.</p><p>The swamp and tree looked normal from afar, but upon closer inspection it was noticed that the swamp not only was filled with tar, but also that the tree was grey, with a grey ridged surface.</p><p>When the minikin attempted to climb the tree, it was promptly discovered that the tree was flimsy, hollow, and broke into pieces under the slightest touch, solid black fumes pouring out of the hole before evaporating into oblivion.</p><p>The pieces that had broken off of the tree, however, lacked gravity, and soon floated back into their original positions, and the fumes ceased to pour out.</p><a href=#the-golden-fruit><h3 id=the-golden-fruit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Golden Fruit</h3></a><p>As the minikin touched the tree more and more, watching it break like dust into black clouds before reforming, they noticed that there was a great lot of fruit at the bottom of the hollow trunk, and the fruit was gold.</p><p>The fruit kept the consistency of real fruit, but appeared shiny and golden, and their insides were wet, fleshy, and white, with a pitch-black stone in the centre.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s leader, a minikin known as Carsái (*tsyal-sahi, or &lsquo;Steppergrass&rsquo;), took the initiative to eat the fruit, but immediately she began to cough, violently hacking up the same solid back fumes of the tree. What the group didn&rsquo;t know nor understand, was that she had contracted the

Carsái attempted to be confident however, and never truly let herself resign to fear.</p><p>While a lot of the group were convinced the event was an apparition that never truly existed or threatened anyone, it soon showed that Carsái would continually and routinely begin coughing more and more of the black fumes, and her state worsened over time.</p><p>The spiritual leaders of the group settled that the event was a Nightmare coming to life and affecting the real world, and while the world may have woken up, Carsai was affected still from eating the fruit.</p><p>A lot of the minikin were scared to be around her for fear of breathing in the fumes once others began to show the same symptoms, and eventually portions her own body began to turn to the same gravityless mass of the tree.</p><a href=#flight-to-nairu><h3 id=flight-to-nairu><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Flight to Nairu</h3></a><p>It was soon that these Mora riSewi minikin decided to move to Nairu, to settle down and maybe find a cure for their afflicted, on account of the advanced medicinal industry of the city-state.</p><p>Carsái proved herself bedridden, laying in a hospital den indefinitely, but she was in good spirits and continued to attempt to guide her group with her wisdom and advice.</p><p>A lot of the group joined the effort to bring a halt to the plague, creating potions, blessing certain mixtures, and creating face-masks to block the black fumes from getting from and to others.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>MB means &lsquo;Millenia Before (the fall of Nairu.)&rsquo;&rsquo; Likewise with YB for &lsquo;Years before,&rsquo; and &lsquo;CB&rsquo; for &lsquo;Centuries before.&rsquo;&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://book.pyxelm.xyz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Mylo Hodges using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://book.pyxelm.xyz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-83oShBjl-0oR57dzvza2g>Youtube</a></li><li><a href=https://pyxelm.bandcamp.com>Bandcamp</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/pyxelm>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
