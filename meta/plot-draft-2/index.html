He was ostracised from his home in the 1st Realm for committing a crime, and was thrown into a magic pit.

Amassing a cult of followers, he fled with them to the 0th Realm and founded the city of Lichenia.</p><p>When he became old, he became convinced that magic was the only way to ensure his continued existence. Not only is this true as magic extends one&rsquo;s lifetime, but he also felt as if Riverbell was not ready to be a leader.</p><p>He murdered his wife, Riverblossom, for her fortuitary gland - and underwent partial

The chapter ends with Toadstool watching Blueberry as he is given a map to Lichenia and walks through a gateway the preacher had made and enters the 0th Realm forest to find the city.</p><a href=#chapter-3><h4 id=chapter-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3</h4></a><p>Chapter 3 focusses on Riverbell, and begins with her waking up to find Blueberry, grizzled and malnourished, a week after the last chapter.
