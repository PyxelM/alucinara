Minikin are the sapient descendents of [0th Realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) squirrels; they reside in the forests, mountains, and steppes of the [2nd Realm](geography/2nd-realm.md). They are prey animals, similar to [Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slug.md), and are hunted by [Birds of Prey](tags/bird-of-prey), [Weasels](species/fauna/weasel.md), and [Pine Martens](species/fauna/pine-marten.md).

## Lifespan
The average Minikin lifespan is 30 years, and they reach maturity at 8-12 years of age.

However, the Minikin lifespan can be lengthened through Alucinarium exposure.

## Morphology
### Height
When Minikin are born, they are often 2.5cm to 7.5cm in height.

At maturity, they often reach a height of 20cm to 30cm.

### Eyes
Minikin eyes are on the front of their head and feature long, bristly eyelashes.

The colour of the Minikin iris can vary. Common iris colours are maroon, brown, green, and dark mauve.

In addition, the colours of minikin sclerae are almost always white, but can also be light pink due to Alucinarium exposure.

### Hair
Minikin exhibit hair only on their heads, chins, tails, and pubic areas. They also feature whiskers on their top lips.

However, as infants, they feature hair all over their bodies except for their fingers, toes, and face. After the first year, all of this hair is lost.

Minikin hair colour can express itself as brown, beige, grey, ginger, or white.

## Prey
Minikin often hunt other animals for medicinal, culinary, and recreational purposes.

### [Gliding Glintoad](species/glintoad/gliding-glintoad.md)
The Gliding Glintoad, Luxlacensis volans, native to the Glowing Lake and itâ€™s outflowing tributary of the Sarvaran River, is often caught, slaughtered, dried, and crushed into a paste which is applied to wounds. This medicine does have a physical basis, as the gliding glowtoad contains alucinari-luciferous bacteria which it uses to aid its immune system and fight infirmity.

### [Fat Toadlet](species/toadlet/fat-toadlet.md)
The Fat Toadlet, Ranucula gurda, a domesticated form of the [Eel Toadlet](species/toadlet/eel-toadlet.md), Ranucula longa, is an fluvio-aquatic livestock animal of Sarvaran fishermen. Fat Toadlets tend to be long, with a tail and short webbed limbs - they exhibit neoteny in that they retain a lot of tadpole features. They are often raised to maturity in aquatic pens, and are eventually slaughtered and sliced sideways into circular sections, and eaten. Since dometication, they have grown a lot of muscle for their meat, hence the name.

### [Triptoad](species/triptoad.md)
The Triptoad, Bufo alucinarifera, is a quaint toad species, not domesticated, but often taken advantage of for recreational purposes due to their psychoactive hallucinogenic properties, often ingested through licking of their mucous, which is excreted from bulging [Fortuitary glands](phenomena/fortuitary-gland.md) on their back.
