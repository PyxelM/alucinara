When a species is named, it will usually have it's english name followed by its scientific binomial name, followed by its Sarvaran minikin name.

For example, the [Gliding Glintoad](species/glintoad/gliding-glintoad.md) is described as 'The Gliding Glintoad, *Luxlacensis volans,* **Pyeku mosralir**.' It features the English name, followed by the Genus name and specific name in *italics*, and then the Sarvaran general name and stative adjective in **bold**.
