The Glowing Lake is a lake from the [Central Continent](geography/2nd-realm/central-continent.md) of the [2nd Realm](geography/2nd-realm.md). It is notable for its deep, glowing teal waters, and the eccentric flora that grows upon its shores.

Flowing out from The Glowing Lake, is the Glowing River, which flows into the greater Sarvaran River and has similar properties if a bit less intense.
