Stonechild Imperial was spoken in the [Empire of the Petrified Child](private/Z%20content.old/cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md) by [Minikin](private/Z%20content.old/fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md). It descended from [Sarvaran](private/Z%20content.old/languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md) and so is part of the [Morellic Language Family](private/Z%20content.old/languages/morellic/morellic-family.md).
