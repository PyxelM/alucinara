title: "Alucinara"
---
Alucinara is a book that explores existentialism and the right to 'save' the world through a cast of three characters;
- one a immature and na√Øve Minikin bandit called [Toadstool](characters/toadstool.md),
- another a culture-shocked but ambitious Demi-Slug vagabond called [Blueberry](characters/blueberry.md),
- and the other a young, cautious Minikin stateswoman called [Fungula](characters/fungula.md).
These characters are all with differing opinions, attributes, and motives for their actions.

It was first concieved by Mylo Hodges in November of 2021 during a creative writing mock-test.
