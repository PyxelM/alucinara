The Morellic Culture is ultimately one of the most widespread cultures of the southern half of the [Western Continent](geography/2nd-realm/western-continent.md).

## [Lunar Calendar](https://app.fantasy-calendar.com/calendars/742eafdf66476b3235dc3b7b413fdf05)
In the morellic lunar calendar, known as 'The Month of the It tracks the moon,' or '*Thǫ̈ Aprelęędjir*' is the main calendar of the Morellic peoples. Its popularity exploded at the height of the Empire of the Petrified Child, whom adopted it in favour of its relevance to their deities.

## Months
The morellic lunar calendar is divided into 8 months of 36 (or 36.0625) [2nd Realm](geography/2nd-realm.md) days. Every 16 months, a leap month is inserted into the year.

## Migration of the Morellic Minikin
The earliest morellic groups inhabited the Saarnic peninsula northwest of the Morellic gulf. Here, the widespread language was Proto-Morellic. Due to the mountainous nature of the peninsula, many communities would be isolated from another - resulting in intense dialectal variation and divergence into separate languages.

Having descended from an equatorial nomadic tree-dwelling tribe titled 'the people who will be strong,' or '*Uinh Sayamitu Mozelyen*,' a lot of the groups inherit their name from the title - hence the term 'Morellic,' from [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) '*Oin Arayamith Morellę*.'

## The Salanh Minikin
One group lived above the river Salanh, meaning 'Green.' This was because of the lush green foliage along the river's bank. This foliage, out of place for a mountainous environment, was actually caused by a baby meadow - one whose sludge flowed down river, enhancing the soil along it for the growth of algae, flora, and fauna.

However, eventually this group migrated from the peninsula. Due to soil depletion and increased natural disasters, a famine struck the land about 7,000 YA. This event was termed 'the terrible era,' or '*Uinh Osvelu Makvenil*.'

The migration spanned a decade, or its equivalent. The group of about 500 people sailed in a fleet of 25 boats of 20 or so people sailed from the peninsula to an area south-west of the Morellic gulf. 100 servants, who formerly served the greatest fishermen in the peninsula, were eventually able to build the boats with wood, reeds, leaves, and linen.

The journey was perilous. While the lands were tameable, the seas were uncontrolled - only used for fishing; no Minikin before had dared to take on the waves, and the people knew they had no other option than to take solace in their gods' protection - despite their isolation from their sacred mountains.

Many myths were formed over the journey - it was said that some were able to split violent eels of the abyss down the middle just by screaming at them just before they devoured an entire boat, that the fleet were fed across their journey with fish that were taken, levitating from the surface of the ocean, into the boats.

While the minikin saw these miracles as help from their deities, it was more likely that the religious monks and spiritual leaders at the front, middle, and sides of the fleet had kept the group safe through fine-tuned use of [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md).

## Founding of Sarvara
Sailing south-west over water and then eastward over land, they travelled to what they would eventually call 'Sarvara,' or '*Sarwarą*.' This was the beginning of the [Sarvaran Culture](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md), a people group native to the banks of the Sarvaran Lake, where the city-state of Sarvara stood.

Mumo, revered as a [Daughter of Stone](religions/morellic.md), was the first queen of Sarvara. Her leadership was the beginning of the matriarchal system that the society and its descendants retained.

### Housing
Similar to their ancestors from the Saarnic Peninsula, the Sarvaran minikin lived in trees. 

#### Clay Use
While the Saarnic minikin had actually slept on leaf beds atop the branches or in hollowed out tree trunks, the Sarvaran minikin would store mud in their cheeks and build clay shelters out of it. This was caused in part by the fact that the new Sarvaran climate and topography was a lot mushier and less rocky, meaning that mud and clay was easily found at the shore of the Sarvaran lake, and the banks of rivers which drained from the lake into the ocean.

#### Defence of Trees
Often, the upper sides of the branches would be filed flat using rocks or other tools, in order to make it harder to slip off. However, in order to make it harder for predators or belligerents to mount the tree, Minikin would commonly dig moats around the base of their trees. They would also build a clay wall surrounding each moat, which eventually sloped outward at the top to make climbing out more difficult; this would also be augmented with slippery substances such as oil or paste.

#### Shelters
These clay shelters would often hang from the branches, featuring a hollow teardrop shape with an open entrance hole to the side, and a hole at the top which was often directly wrapped around and attached to the branch. Often, the outer walls of these shelters would feature religious markings, tallies for shelters which stored crops, as well as other shapes etched into the clay.

#### Banners
Some of the richer Minikin opted to adorn their trees with banners which displayed family emblems among other icons. They did this as to scare off theives, display reputation, as well as simply marking a tree as their own.

### Writing
Sarvaran writing was heavily connected to the art of weaving. The Sarvaran logography developed from sewing mythic scenes into fabric, and was eventually standardised many times for military cartography, accounting, and record keeping.

#### Spread
In fact, many other cultures adopted the Sarvaran logography for their own languages, and it was spread by nomadic cultures who would employ the logography in trade. For example, a nomadic minikin might travel from city to city, each time keeping track of what has been bought and sold, teaching the native merchants the system as they travelled.
