It is commonly observed as being purple or pink, as this is the colour it takes when inactive.\n\n## Uses\nAlucinarium is used by many organisms for many reasons. Some plant and animal species have evolved to use it in order to stun predators with a bright flash of light when disturbed, and some [infra-essent](alucinara/realms/infra-essence.md) entities have evolved to use it in order to pull prey into their grasp by altering gravitational energy.\n\n## See Also\n- [Realms](alucinara/realms/realms.md)\n- [Infra-essence](alucinara/realms/infra-essence.md)\n- [Phantasmarrhoea](illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md)\n\n---\n## Names\nProto-Morellic: *Aluhkinar* `/ä.luç̠ˈki.när/`\n\nSarvaran: *Ellohkį́dä* `/e.ɬɔxˈkĩ́.dɑ/`\n\nStonechild Imperial: *Dho'ít* `/ðo.ˈʔít/`","lastmodified":"2022-09-11T11:46:46.094421856Z","tags":null},"/alucinara/realms/gateway":{"title":"Alucinara Gateways","content":"Alucinara Gateways are used by Realm-Hoppers in order to travel between realms, although most people do not due to the danger of an unfamiliar world - Realm Hoppers often tend to be miners, scientists and bandits.\n\n## Creation\nAlucinara Gateways are often created by depositing Alucinarium onto a location, whence a gateways will form as a purple, sparkling, swirling portal, often the size of a [Minikin](fauna/2nd%20realm/minikin/minikin.md) - although the size can vary depending on the amount used.\n\n---\n## Names\nProto-Morellic: *Klamoaluheh* `/klä.mɔä̯ˈlu.ɣɛç̠/`\n\nSarvaran: *Kllęboęnyí* `/kɬẽ.bɔẽ̯ˈnýí̯/`\n\nStonechild Imperial: *Lęboęnyí* `/lẽ.boẽ̯ˈnýí̯/`","lastmodified":"2022-09-11T11:46:46.094421856Z","tags":null},"/alucinara/realms/infra-essence":{"title":"Infra-essence and Ultra-Essence","content":"Infra-essence and Ultra-essence are the names given to the phenomena of places, objects, and entities existing within the many [realms](alucinara/realms/realms.md) of [Alucinara](/_index.md).\n\n## Terminology\n**Ultra-essent** is the name given to phenomena of realms [0°e](locations/0th-realm.md) and above.

**Octal** counting system\n\n### Nouns\nNouns in Proto-Morellic were divided into 3 classes or genders, with 3 noun cases, Nominative, Accusative, and Dative, and 2 numbers, Singular and Plural.\n\n#### Beneficial\nBeneficial gender was used for pronouns, body parts, edible foods, and healthy phenomena such as sunlight.\nBeneficial|Singular|Plural\n----------|--------|------\nNominative|`-i`      |`-jɛt`\nAccusative|`-äs`     |`-äsɛt`\nDative    |`-ur`     |`-urɛt`\n\n#### Benign\nBenign gender was used for non-threatening non-beneficial animals, phenomena which didn't effect health, and some foods.\nBenign|Singular|Plural\n----------|--------|------\nNominative|`-ɛç̠`     |`-ɛɣuc̠`\nAccusative|`-iɫ`     |`-iluc̠`\nDative    |`-ɛt`     |`-ɛtuc̠`\n\n#### Malign\nMalign gender was used for dangerous animals, dangerous phenomena such as lava, illnesses, and inedible or poisonous foods.\nMalign|Singular|Plural\n----------|--------|------\nNominative|`-är`     |`-äräm`\nAccusative|`-id`     |`-idäm`\nDative    |`-ɔm`     |`-ɔmäm`\n\n### Verbs\nVerbs in Proto-Morellic were declined for whether the action was volitional or not.\n\nFor example, **Sneezing** would be non-volitional, and would take the `-ve` suffix unless it was done on purpose (somehow.)\n\nIn addition, Proto-Morellic also had 3 tenses, Non-past, Past, and Distant Past, which  was also used as a Gnomic tense in some cases.\n\nIt also had 4 aspects, Imperfect, Perfect, Progressive, and Prospective, for whether an action isn't completed, is completed, is progressing, and whether it is going to happen.\n\nVolitional    |Non-past|Past     |Distant Past\n--------------|--------|---------|------------\nImperfect     |-du     |fa-du    |si-du\nPerfect       |-dura   |fa-dura  |si-dura\nProgressive   |-dune   |fa-dune  |si-dune\nProspective   |-duzu   |fa-duzu  |si-duzu\n\nNon-volitional|Non-past|Past     |Distant Past\n--------------|--------|---------|------------\nImperfect     |-ve     |fa-ve    |si-ve\nPerfect       |-vera   |fa-vera  |si-vera\nProgressive   |-vene   |fa-vene  |si-vene\nProspective   |-vezu   |fa-vezu  |si-vezu\n\n### Examples\n#### \"Owen is eating parsnips in the rain\"\n\n\u003e Uhkidune Oueni duombaset euslaur

volitional verb suffix, `/-du/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əduʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/ədu/` \"to be sure of one's self\" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` \"-ly / converbialiser\"\n\n#### Nonvolitional suffix\nThe nonvolitional verb suffix, `/-vɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əhvɛʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əhv/` \"to be lost or confused\" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` \"-ly / converbialiser\"\n\n#### Perfect suffix\nThe perfect verb suffix, `/-rä/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/räʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/rä/` \"to complete\" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` \"-ly / converbialiser\"\n\n#### Progressive suffix\nThe progressive verb suffix, `/-nɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/nəʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/nə/` \"to move, be active\" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` \"-ly / converbialiser\"\n\n#### Prospective suffix\nThe prospective verb suffix, `/-zu/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əzuʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əzu/` \"to want, to wish\" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` \"-ly / converbialiser\"\n\n#### Past prefix\nThe past verb prefix, `/fä-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əfɐh/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning \"there\"\n\n#### Disant past prefix\nThe distant past verb prefix, `/si-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/ʍsih/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning \"another age\"\n\n#### Proto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/\nProto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/ itself was derived form the root `/hɛʍ/`, meaning \"like, similar\", but was almost entirely lost in Proto-Morellic.\n\n## Examples\n\u003e
