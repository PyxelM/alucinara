It is commonly observed as being purple or pink, as this is the colour it takes when inactive.\n\n# Uses\nAlucinarium is used by many organisms for many reasons. Some plant and animal species have evolved to use it in order to stun predators with a bright flash of light when disturbed, and some [infra-essent](alucinara/realms/infra-essence.md) entities have evolved to use it in order to pull prey into their grasp by altering gravitational energy.\n\n# See Also\n- [realms](alucinara/realms/realms.md)\n- [infra-essence](alucinara/realms/infra-essence.md)\n- [phantasmarrhoea](illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md)\n\n# Names\nProto-Morellic: *Aluhkinar* `/ä.luç̠ˈki.när/`\n\nSarvaran: *Ellohkį́dä* `/e.ɬɔxˈkĩ́.dɑ/`\n\nStonechild Imperial: *Edho'ít* `/e.ðo.ˈʔít/`","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T10:46:07.710733041Z","tags":null},"/alucinara/realms/gateway":{"title":"Alucinara Gateways","content":"Alucinara Gateways are used by Realm-Hoppers in order to travel between realms, although most people do not due to the danger of an unfamiliar world - Realm Hoppers often tend to be miners, scientists and bandits.\n\n# Creation\nAlucinara Gateways are often created by depositing Alucinarium onto a location, whence a gateways will form as a purple, sparkling, swirling portal, often the size of a [Minikin](fauna/minikin/minikin.md) - although the size can vary depending on the amount used.\n\n# Names\nProto-Morellic: *Klamoaluheh* `/klä.mɔä̯ˈlu.ɣɛç̠/`\n\nSarvaran: *Kllęboęnyí* `/kɬẽ.bɔẽ̯ˈnýí̯/`\n\nStonechild Imperial: *Lęboęnyí* `/lẽ.boẽ̯ˈnýí̯/`","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T10:46:07.710733041Z","tags":null},"/alucinara/realms/infra-essence":{"title":"Infra-essence and Ultra-Essence","content":"Infra-essence and Ultra-essence are the names given to the phenomena of places, objects, and entities existing within the many [realms](alucinara/realms/realms.md) of [Alucinara](/_index.md).\n\n## Terminology\n**Ultra-essent** is the name given to phenomena of realms [0°e](locations/0th-realm.md) and above.

The tide hasn't returned to us in millenia, but we still see the ripples created by those whom travel across the pools. For instance, take a black hole - It could merely be a distortion in spacetime caused by the death of a star, but the activity of black holes is also known to coincide with supernatural sightings on Earth. It is my hypothesis that the tide is returning - and these events are the ripples created by those who enter our pool through the waves. ― Eugene W.
