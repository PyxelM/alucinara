These three elements come together to create a morellic garment.\n## Colour\nThere are many [dyes](materials/dyes.md) to choose from, all of which have different effects on different fabrics. Dyes are not used when tanning. Different dyes are used to create different feelings such as that of opulence, poverty, or occupation.\n## Material\nThere are three most common types of material used in clothing;\n- Firm\n- Elastic\n- Baggy\n### Firm\nFirm materials are those like tanned leaves, thick fabric, or leather. They are usually very firm, thick, dark, and are used in pieces such as the waist-belt and tunic. They are usually made out of animal hide, felt, or longleaf.\n### Elastic\nElastic material is self-explanatory; it is soft fabric that stretches. It is commonly used in places where stretching is common, such as the cuffs, waistband, and undershirt. They are commonly made out of fibres such as silk.\n### Baggy\nBaggy material is also fabric; it is generally pleated or draped over the body. They are generally created out of plant fibres such as flax or linen.\n## Shape\nThere are many shapes that are indicative of a morellic garment. These are:\n- Bell-shaped openings\n- Tunics or Capes that cross over themselves in an X shape over the chest area.\n- Shoes that protect the toes and wrap the rest of the foot in a spiral.\n### Tunic\nThe tunics on morellic clothing are characterised by their cross-shaped overlap placed over the chest. This not only gives customisability as for how much skin to show around the neck, but also creates a pleasing V-neck shaped design. The tunic is commonly made out of firm material.\n\nThis cross-shaped overlap is created by using a long piece of material which is draped over the shoulders, overlapped, and tucked into the waist-belt. Sometimes, some additions are made, such as;\n- Pins\n- Buttons\n- Straps\n- Laces\n#### Pins\nIn the case of pins, a circular or oblong pin is used to fasten the upper layer to the lower layer. These pins, similar to safety pins, are often decorated with cute pictures, [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), and designs, and help the overlap to stay in place. One to three is the usual amount of pins used.\n#### Buttons\nSimilar to pins, buttons are also decorated with symbols or pictures. They are sewn into the lower layer's side of the tunic,  and are fed into holes on the other side, in order to make sure that the overlap does not come undone.\n#### Straps\nThe use of straps is less common, but is standard for active, athletic, or bandit minikin. They are used with non-overlapped tunics, ones which do not have an X-shape but simply ride down the shoulders leaving a gap in between.\n\nStraps are used to customise the length of the gap. Keeping the V-neck design, they are used to bring the sides of the tunic together, leaving little to no gap. There is usually no more than 1 strap used, if any.\n#### Laces\nLaces are used in a similar way to straps, only using a string to tie the gap closed on non-overlapping tunics. The laces are often fed through multiple holes and are tied into intricate symbols or designs.\n### Waist-Belt\nThe waist belt is a ubiquitous aspect of morellic clothing. Their thickness can vary from thin to wide. Thin belts feature a buckle simply to do its job, but wider belts can feature symbols or designs on their buckles, such as metal engravings.\n\nWaist belts are commonly made out of leather or tanned leaves, are placed atop the waistband which the undershirt is tucked into. Sometimes, patterns are scored into the belts, such as concentric lines or diagonal repeating lines.\n### Undershirt\nThe undershirt is made up of two parts - the sleeves, and the body section. The undershirt is generally made out of elastic material and features a simple overlapping shape.\n\nThere is no gap in the centre of some undershirts, in which case the overlap is sewn into the bottom of the undershirt and buttons are optionally added. In undershirts with a gap, the gap is closed using lace, which also has many holes to be fed through and tied into intricate shapes.\n### Sleeves\nSleeves are the visible portion of the undershirt, and are made from baggy material. They may be short, or go down to the wrist; they are bell shaped, flaring with pleats which are sewn closed at the end of the sleeves. At the end, one may add a cuff, or may forgo this option. There are many cuff designs:\n- Tube Cuff\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### Tube Cuff\nThe tube cuff is named for its cylindrical shape. It is simply a tube attached to the end of the sleeve, close to skin-tight. They generally have two straps at their beginning and end to customise their circumference, although some only have one strap at the end.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff is similar to the tube cuff, only it doesn't go in a tube shape for does it stay close to the skin. Rather, it flares outward in a waving ruffled pattern. The length of this cuff can vary from short to very long in some cases, but it never exceeds past the hand when fit correctly.\n#### No Cuff\nNo cuff simply means that the sleeve ends when the pleats are sewn together, with no continuation. This option is uncommon for arm sleeves, and is usually taken when a cuff is too expensive to add; it is a cultural indicator of poverty.\n### Trousers\nTrousers can be calf-length or longer, but never end any further than the ankle. They are similarly bell-shaped with pleats, like sleeves, but have different customs for their waistband and cuffs.\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### No Cuff\nUnlike arm-sleeves, no cuffs on trousers is much less frowned upon. It is largely the norm for trousers.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff on trousers is always very short. It serves as a fashion decoration to demonstrate wealth or romantic favourability.\n#### Waistband\nIn addition, the waistband of morellic clothing is always very important. It is connected to the rest of the trousers, and is usually reinforced with a stretchy, elastic material. The undershirt is tucked into the trousers and the waist-belt is put atop the waistband, helping comfortability.\n### Shoes\nMorellic shoes are the most alien to humans. Due to their digitigrade feet, they feature small soles and long heels. Sometimes, shoes are simply not worn. The appearance of morellic shoes can vary from boots to glorified socks. There are two sections:\n- The toe section\n- The heel section\nSometimes, when the toe section is missed out, the heel section continues to the end of the foot, leaving the toes exposed, and a soft insole is tucked in between the soles and the fabric.\n#### Toe Section\nThe toe section has a firm dome that covers the upper side of the toes, and a hard underside that protects the soles from harm. Sometimes, the firm dome and hard underside are simply missed out; this is a sign of poverty. They are lined with a soft insole.\n#### Heel Section\nThe heel section is relatively simple, it is just a piece of fabric connected to the toe section that wraps around the heel as if it were a bandage. The heel section is often tucked into the trousers.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.441933969Z","tags":["minikin","morellic","clothing"]},"/deities/the-darkness":{"title":"The Darkness","content":"## Overview\nThe Darkness, also known as 'Life,' is a deity that governs the way in which living beings operate.

It descends from the pre-shattering force of Goodness, travels by floating metres above the ground, and can shift across realms at its own discretion.\n## Appearance\n![Petrified Child](images/petrified-child.png)\n\nThe Petrified Child has the appearance of a swaddled infant, and is approximately 5 metres in length. It has the body of a bean-like inverse teardrop, a surface texture of shifting, looped ridges, and a round face on the front of its upper half. \n\nIts face takes many forms, often shifting depending on who the Petrified Child is facing. For example, to the [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md), it appears with the face of a minikin child, and to the [demi-slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md), the face of a demi-slug child.\n\nDuring the reign of the Empire of the Petrified Child, it was commonly depicted with the face of an owl, owing to the animalistic masks worn in Stonechild Imperial society.\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of the Petrified Child is to destroy evil where it may arise. The term 'evil' is not a term defined in the petrified child's mind, as to allow for a case-by-case conclusion on wether or not an offender needs to be destroyed.\n\nThe method by which the petrified child destroys is by disintegrating all but the offender's skeleton into an organic fertiliser known as 'Baby Sludge,' an alucinariferous substance far more conducive to plant growth and ecosystemic health than other fertilisers, due to its inherent volume of nutrients as well as magic influence.\n\n### Baby Meadows\nA 'Baby Meadow' is the term for the resulting oasis-like region that arises after baby sludge becomes incorporated into the earth. Following the destruction of evil, a baby meadow goes through three stages;\n\n#### Stage 1\nFollowing disintegration, the baby sludge settles on the ground and is partly absorbed into the soil. Little ecosystemic proliferation takes place in this stage, as the baby sludge is so severe that any flora or fauna in the vicinity will suffer from fungal or bacterial infection upon coming in contact with it.\n\nThis stage features mass ecological decline in the immediate area; the outward appearance of a baby meadow at this stage is that of a flat plain with a skeleton at its centre and decomposing trees, shrubbery, and animals scattered about.\n\n#### Stage 2\nThis is the stage at which the immediate danger has subsided, and nature begins to reclaim the area with greater ferocity than before. Alongside the proliferation of the local greenery, animals from other habitats may migrate to the area to feed upon the new food sources brought with the ecosystemic growth, especially if they are collecting food for hibernation.\n\nAlongside this appearance of new herbivorous fauna, predatory animals will similarly frequent the area in search of prey. Some predators, having smelled the appearance of baby sludge, will have shed their normal coats of fur over the first stage in favour of a coat of better camouflage, hiding in the brush until a prey animal walks by.\n\nThe appearance of this stage is similarly plain like the previous stage, but it otherwise features the proliferation of dense fruiting, blooming shrubbery, and the appearance of animals arriving to feed. At this point, moss, lichen, and vines will have begun growing on the skeletal remains, resulting in a characteristic green shade to the bones with blossoms growing from the surface.\n\n#### Stage 3\nThe final stage is the least dangerous relative to the previous stages, featuring little danger and little predators than wouldn't usually be expected. By this point, the ecosystemic proliferation will have ceased, and the health of the flora will sustain itself in the natural cycle of nutrients into plants and back into the ground.\n\nAt this point, the central skeleton may have rotted and crumbled, serving as fertiliser in and of itself, or it will have stayed standing in the case of stronger skeletons. The appearance of this stage is marked by the appearance of tall green trees; if the skeleton hasn't disappeared it will surely be hidden by the lush trees which will have grown in the area.\n\nFrom here on, the area will stay relatively constant in state, featuring dense flora. Over time the region may be overcome with other flora, resembling a baby meadow less and less after the initial propagation declines, but this is a very slow process due to the influence of Alucinara in the area following the dissemination of baby sludge.\n\n## Detection of Evil\nThe petrified child detects evil through 'eyes' scattered across the realms. A fair proportion of these eyes exist naturally, but the majority of these eyes were carved by the [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) and [Stonechild](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md) minikin, after it was discovered they could be created manually.\n\n'Eyes' are rock formations given use by their physical resemblance to eyes or faces. They were discovered by an early [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) group of minikin who realised that the petrified child came to save them from danger only when there was a nearby cliff face or boulder with eyes formed into the surface.\n\nThe formation of these eyes is greatly helped by Alucinarium content in the rock, as this often causes the surface to shift into the shape of a face. This is often hastened by the process of erosion.\n\n### Watchstones\nOnce the morellic minikin had discovered this, they began to seek out rocks and carve faces into them, commonly as a good luck charm. These came to be known as '[Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md).'\n\nA lot of these rocks would be ineffective as they would be hidden away in a pocket, unable to see out of the fabric. So, the morellic minikin would sometimes cut holes in their pockets so that the eyes could see out.\n\nAn innovation came when early-stonechild minikin discovered that carving alucinarium geodes into watchstones worked to allow them to move, tremendously increasing the field of view of the watchstones.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.441933969Z","tags":["deity","petrified-child","featured"]},"/lore/creation-story":{"title":"The Creation Story","content":"## Overview\nIn this note, I will describe the canonical creation story. In-world, it is believed by the [Morellic Minikin](groups/morellic-minikin.md), but was diverged from or was abandoned by many other groups who believe other stories. It features the tale behind the First and Second Judges, and eventually the emergence of Life.\n## See Also:\n- [The History of the Móra riSéwi Minikin](lore/mora-risewi-history.md)\n- [The History of the Morellic Minikin](lore/histories/morellic-history.md)\n## Events\nAt first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The void was wholly empty, except for two spirits, the First Judge and the Second. The judges were created by nothing but for the inherent obligation of creating beauty.\n\nThe first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they created the universe with the aim to make it beautiful with the help of the forces.\n### The Forces\nThere were initially two spiritual forces, through which the universe operated;\n- The first force, Nature, would give the universe form and order, resulting in the existence of matter, temperature, gravity, etc.\n- The second force, Truth, allowed the universe to stay consistent, following true rules that could never be broken.\n\nStars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which served to create beauty, but a somber kind of beauty. The universe was beautiful, yes, but no living thing could call it home. The universe wasn't designed for inhabitants.\n### Life\nHowever, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create a force all of its own; *life*. This third force created a spiritual essence known as Darkness, which fed upon the material of the universe, destroying all in its path.\n### A Dark Mistake\nThe Darkness immediately grew disproportionate in power once it had fed upon nebulae and galaxies, thriving under the laws of nature that weren't built to restrict it. Eventually, it grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the First Judge once the last star was gone.\n\nThe First Judge was furious when it had discovered the Darkness, disgusted and mortified that the essence had taken the horrifying purpose of feeding upon and destroying the beauty of the created universe.\n### The Battle\nThe judge immediately clashed with Darkness. The two other forces were employed in all of their power to combat the effects of Life; but it was no use, and the Darkness pressed in upon the first judge until it was wholly enveloped and destroyed.\n\nthe Darkness, in its overwhelmingly massive quantity, went to subsume the First Judge. The Judge exerted the forces of creation a thousand times over to push them away, but it was of no use against the greedy, ever hungry, mass.\n\nTerrified, the Second Judge sacrificed itself, turning it's energy into the [Second Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a vain attempt to save its companion. These new laws served to impose restrictions on the Darkness, and created the fourth force known as 'Goodness' to govern Life, and destroy any evil thing under its watch.\n\nIn the First Judge's last moments, it used the last ounces of it's energy to create the fifth force of [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), a force that allowed the First Laws to exist in place of the Second. This meant that the beauty the judge had created could still exist, and the Darkness could also live on.\n## Aftermath\n### The Shattering of the Realms\nThe universe was greatly weakened by the shockwave created in the First Judge's death; The explosion created would later be known as the Big Bang or the Supernova, which caused the universe to shatter into thousands of realms.\n### Beauty\n'Beauty' as a quality of the universe was originally defined by the Judges but, once they were destroyed, it became an inherent aspect of the universe; it is not necessarily a definition of how 'beautiful' something may be in the human sense of the word, but rather how close it comes in aesthetic to the universe pre-shattering.\n\nAlucinara, as it enforces the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md), causes anything it affects to become more alike the old universe, unless it is unstable. The most beautiful realms are the most alucinara-rich, but so are the least beautiful, as they have the least stable Alucinara energy.\n### The Realms\n99% of all realms became empty and inaccessible; these disintegrated from their instability into the void-space between all stable realms. In the end, only 7 realms remained. Three infra-essent realms, one non-essent realm, and 3 ultra-essent realms.\n#### Essence\nAll lasting realms were defined by a quality known as 'essence.' This term describes the beauty of the realms, the least beautiful realms being the most 'infra-essent' and the most beautiful being the most 'ultra-essent.'\n\nThe 0th realm was virtually unaffected by Alucinara outside of the supernova, and thus is described as non-essent. The ultra-essent realms are the most fantastical, influenced the most by stable Alucinara, and the infra-essent realms are the most morose, influenced the most by unstable Alucinara.\n#### Alucinara Gateways\nA method of traversing the realms was 'Alucinara Gateways.' These gateways were a type of portal, created through [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), that allowed matter or energy to pass from one realm to another.\n\nSome limits are present in traversing realms however; it is the easiest to travel to the nearest or most co-essent realms; i.e. if one were in the 2nd Realm, it would require the least effort to create a gateway to the -2nd, 1st, or 3rd realms.\n#### Essential shift\nThe term 'essential shift' describes the process that takes place when matter or energy travels across a realm. It most commonly occurs upon the use of an Alucinara Gateway, but there are other ways for it to occur.\n\nFor example, infra-essential shift is a symptom of Phantasmarrhoea, where one is involuntarily transported to one of the least beautiful realms at the most advanced stage of the curse. \n\nFurthermore, mass-essential shift took place when the Supernova reached Earth. It is the reason that the squirrels of the 0th realm entered the 2nd realm and developed into [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md).\n### The Deities\nUpon the shattering of the realms, the forces gained physical bodies due to the second laws of nature. These bodies appeared as rocky mineral deposits piloted and puppeted by their respective force.\n#### The Petrified Child\nOne of these deities was the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), the manifestation of the force 'Goodness.' It governed the living beings of the essent realms, using [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) as a form of surveillance to see and know when evil takes place.\n\nUpon the detection of evil, it would destroy it, turning it into 'baby sludge,' a fertiliser that facilitates the blooming of beautiful 'baby meadows.'\n### The Darkness\nAnother deity was the [Darkness](deities/the-darkness.md), the manifestation of the force of the same name. It governed the methods by which a being may live, taking the form of the building blocks of life - Hydrocarbons, found in tar, asphalt, and amino acids.\n\nThis meant that the Darkness could continue to live. Hydrocarbons and Alucinara create the Soul, and the Soul and a viable body create a living being. This level of restriction now meant that Darkness could no longer destroy beauty to the same degree that it had in the past.\n### The Pond\nThe Second Laws of Nature resolved to banish the Darkness to the void-space between every realm known as the Pond, an afterlife (or 'outer' life) where the Darkness within a soul goes upon expiry or creation of a body.\n\nUpon death, the Darkness will return to the Pond through [Frequencial Shift](phenomena/frequencial-shift). This can be circumvented with [soulstones](phenomena/soulstone.md), in which case the darkness will bind to the asphalt in the stone and remain outside of the Pond.\n\nDarkness also appears outside of the Pond when impure. In these cases, it can be found in tar pits and bitumen, where it is combined in a mixture with other elements.\n### The Laws of Nature\nAs the void-space had been emptied by the Darkness' destruction, life now had no chance of thriving there, in the Pond. The only way that it could live on was by feeding upon the last beauty contained within the realms.\n\nThe Second Laws, in tandem with the First, turned the Darkness from a devouring mass of evil into the magical souls that inhabit the quaint, sickly living beings that eat leaves, soil, and flesh.\n## Species of the Realms\nIn every realm, many many species had developed. The species of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with Alucinara. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.\n### The Supernova\nIn 80 [MyBS](lore/sarvaran-calendar.md), the shockwave created when the First Judge was destroyed had finally reached the Earth; the first supernova. As the Judge had created [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) upon it's death, the supernova was rich in alucinara energy, resulting in the mass-essential shift of 1% of all matter affected.\n\nThere was virtually no destruction on that day, but the many living beings affected were now displaced. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into the essent realms from the 0th. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.\n### New Species\n- [The Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md)\n- [The Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md)\n- [The Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md)\n- \n[^1]: Having the same distance from the 0th Realm","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["mythology","lore","featured"]},"/lore/histories/morellic-history":{"title":"History of the Morellic Minikin","content":"The history of the Morellic [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) is long, beginning with the Mora tribe.\n## The Mora Race\nThe Mora were a race of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md), subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.\n\nBy their peak, the Mora held 6 tribes of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these tribes was the Sewi, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.\n## The Sewi Tribe\nThe Sewi, led by a matriarch known as Dilvîdh, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.\n\nThe largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the Mora; a city known as Endîrun, meaning 'city of farms,' built upon the annually-flooding river Erücâs, meaning 'river of the east,' in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.\n## The Sewi Civil War\nHowever, the stability of the Sewi was thrown into question upon Dilvîdh's death. Her eldest, the disabled matriarch Viga, was assassinated by the command of her sibling Ferna, who thought that she was better suited to rule.\n\nThis led to a bloody civil war, causing the decimation of the Sewi population. Two tribes split off; the Lantâna, led by Dilvîdh's now eldest, Wírildh, and the Djerâya, led by Ferna. The two began to fight for matriarchal power over the Sewi.\n### The Battle over the Erücâs\nIn a battle fought over the river Erücâs, the Djerâya were flanked from the west by the Lantâna military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.\n\nThe battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of Djerâya minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lantâna victorious, the Djerâya were defeated, but the battle left Endîrun inhospitable, run-down, and littered with [Baby Meadows](deities/the-petrified-child.md).\n## Proliferation of the Northeast\nWhile the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river Erücâs caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lantâna's part.\n\nHaving received prophecy of a famine, Wírildh made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lantâna and Djerâya, to the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.\n\nThis was a success, initially; the Lantâna built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of Endîrun to the west, known as New Endîrun. There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other Mora tribes moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.\n\nIn addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the Mora minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Hanyârï.\n### The Famine\nDespite the Lantâna's efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from [The Mother Tree](deities/mother-tree.md) to punish the Lantâna for preparing with such violence.\n\nThe total population of the Mora halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving Djerâya minikin attempted to take over the Lantâna once more.\n## The Yu'aha\nFollowing the loss over the Erücâs, the surviving Djerâya fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lantâna and sympathetic Mora in the neighbouring nation of the Yu'aha tribe to the west.\n\nMotivated by racism and jealousy, the Yu'aha, led by the patriarch Ero'u and his vizier Arêven (Ferna's grand-daughter, the new Djerâya matriarch), passed east over the river Koyhots against the Lantâna.\n### The Weakening of the Lantâna\nThe Yu'aha didn't take to raiding cities such as New Endîrun, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lantâna's territory. These settlements were the nation's main source of food, especially those built on the Erücâs.\n\nThe Yu'aha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lantâna farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lantâna, and made them dependent on the hostile Yu'aha for the little food in the area left.\n### Arêven's Plans\nUnbeknownst to Ero'u, his vizier Arêven was rounding the Djerâya and their mercenaries against the Lantâna, with the intent to attack New Endîrun and genocide the Lantâna in their weakened state.\n\nWhile the Yu'aha were concerned with oppressing and virtually enslaving the Lantâna, the Djerâya were concerned with complete annihilation - a prospect unappealing to the Yu'aha.\n\nThis was discovered by the Lantâna-sympathetic supreme priest of the Yu'aha, Rwenedh the Blind, whom was 1 quarter Lantâna. He, in secret, told the Lantâna matriarch Viga II (grand-daughter of Wirîldh) of the Djerâya's plans.\n### Lantâna-Hanyârï League\nUpon hearing of this, the Lantâna proposed a military alliance with the Hanyârï in order to fight the Djerâya upon the dawn of their genocidal campaign, which was accepted.\n\nLetting the Djerâya continue in their plans, they waited for a direct attack, while massing an army of Hanyârï soldiers and Lantâna commanders. While the famine was chipping away at the Lantâna, the Hanyârï territory was still abundant in food, allowing the Djerâya to remain.\n### Seige of New Endîrun\nThis direct attack came in the Siege of New Endîrun. Blindsided, the Yu'aha provided no support, and in fact executed every Djerâya official in power. Arêven and her generals were the only Djerâya nobles in power at this point, but their fiery hatred proved them unaffected by the response to their betrayal.\n\nIn the battle, the walls were broken down and trade routes disrupted. The League was able to hold off the Djerâya for a while, but the Lantâna eventually surrendered and fled the city in search of refuge.\n## Migration of the Lantâna\nFollowing the surrender of the Lantâna, a vast portion of their men were taken as slaves by the Djerâya. The rest resolved to travel south, returning to the nomadic lifestyle they had left behind in Endîrun.\n\nThe most of the men left were the disabled, those unworthy of labour, all of whom were euthanized as the Lantâna began to travel. Some were cannibalised to maximise food during the famine, which led to many retaliations from the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md).\n### Arrival at the Lakes\nTravelling from the steppe through the deserts, living as nomads, the tribe reached the equatorial saltwater lakes and the surrounding rainforests, now led by the matriarch Sourél (grand-daughter of Viga II.)\n#### Geography\nThere were two lakes that divided the north of [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md) from the south, a larger lake to the west and a smaller to the east.\n\nThe Western lake, known as Eséribh, was home to the native Kastéirra race of minikin. The Kastéirra were divided into 3 main tribes, the Néth to the south, Veláni to the north, and Kîrlégh in the southeastern inner corner of the lake. \n\nThe Eastern Lake, known as Anghôlï, was home to the Urűnnu race of minikin. The Urűnnu was made up of the Káuneph to the south and the Hanyârï to the north - a group the Lantâna had already met.\n### Dispersion into Nearby areas\nThe Lantâna felt this was an opportune time to settle down once more, as the lakes provided a pseudo-maritime role reminiscent of the Endîrunic coasts. The largest Lantâna settlement built after the migration was known as Náirų, a port city on the inner southeastern corner of the lake Anghôlï. \n\nThe Lantâna were largely peaceful with the natives, respecting their borders and customs, creating a healthy economic relationship.\n## The Aurűk\nFollowing years of cohabitation, some Lantâna and Kîrlégh Kastéirra hybridised, forming the new Aurűk tribe at their border, although some Kastéirra and Lantâna groups further from the border did not hybridise, and rather retained their earlier culture. The first Aurűk matriarch was known as Mǫ́th (Sourél's daughter.)\n#### Appearance\nThe Aurűk were defined by their brown skin, bristly hair, and the fur that grew from their hands, feet, and extremities, resembling the Kastéirra minikin as well as the Mora.\n#### Language\nThe Lantâna began to speak Old Sarvaran, a language developed from Proto-Morellic. The Aurűk dialect of Old Sarvaran developed into a pidgin, and eventually the Aurűk creole, influenced by the Kîrlégh superstrate dialect.\n#### Religion\nHaving picked up many cultural practices throughout the Lantâna migration and merging with the Kastéirra, they also developed their own [unique religion](religion/auruk-religion.md).\n### Conflict with Veláni\nWhile the Aurűk retained healthy trade and diplomacy with these groups, the Veláni were violent, seeing this ethnic hybridisation as a sort of 'impurity.' The Veláni performed many raids on Aurűk settlements, with the eventuality that they should attempt to conquer Náirų.\n### Aurűk-Veláni Borderland\nMany border skirmishes occurred between the Aurűk and Veláni. This led to the creation of many Baby Meadows, which increased soil fertility, and thus the establishment of many farming towns.\n\nDue to the volatile position of these towns, many guard posts were constructed in the canopy of the surrounding rainforest, on trees and guard towers. Due to the increased pressure from the Veláni, many advancements were made.\n### Advancements in Defence and Offence\nSome innovations were made in the field of archery and cavalry.\n\nWhile minikin had previously hunted and battled by hurling pointy objects at each other through [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), the Aurűk began to create specialised arrows. Arrows would be blessed with [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md) to create a certain effect, could now be kept within a quiver, and more than one could be shot at once.\n\nIn addition, they began to train some native mustelids known as War Weasels into aiding in battle. These War Weasels would learn to stay calm during a fight, and pay attention to cues from their rider into performing tactical movements, evasion, and war dances. Some war weasels would be blessed with symbolic brands.\n## Veláni War\n\n### Aftermath\n## Founding of Sarvara, etc.\nsarvara was south east of the lakes, neth was directly on them, and kaseirra was a hybrid of the kaseirrith and morellic minikin, to the east on the coast of the sarvaran gulf, to the north of sarvara.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["morellic","lore","featured"]},"/lore/locations/tseireph":{"title":"Tseiréph","content":"## Overview\nTseiréph is the central continent of the 2nd Realm.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["locations","continents"]},"/meta/plot-draft-1":{"title":"Book Plan","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Structure\n- ### Poem 1\n\n\n- ### Chapter 1\nThis chapter focuses on [Blueberry](characters/blueberry).

The temple appears pristine from the outside, but the inside is overgrown due to the Petrified Child's interference. The group comes across a large gateway leading to the atrium - the petrified child's face is slotted into the wall and the face of the god watches over the hall of long dead worshippers. Throughout the chapter, the characters face puzzles that are symbolic of their own journeys.

He was ostracised from his home in the 1st Realm for committing a crime, and was thrown into a magic pit. Magic is less prevalent in the -1st realm, so it was a major culture shock for magic to be so commonplace in the 2nd Realm, which added to his want to flee.\n#### Motivations:\n- He wants to find a place to settle down, but he is convinced there is little to no places that suit him\n- So he wants to rid the world of magic and evil.\n### Toadstool\nToadstool is a Minikin. He became a bandit as he was maturing, which led to an impressionable cousin of his joining as well and getting indirectly killed while on the job. After this, his family began to hate him, so he tries to prove himself as a good person at every opportunity.\n#### Motivations:\n- He wants to prove himself to his family that he's a good person and not a murderer,\n- and he wants to rid the world of evil so that what happened to his cousin can never happen again.\n### Riverbell\nRiverbell is a Minikin. She is the daughter of Mossrot, who murdered his wife, her mother, and disappeared. Mossrot led the settlement of Lichenia, which meant that the leadership position was thrust upon her. Due to this trauma, she constantly tries to protect her village.\n#### Motivations:\n- She wants to protect her city at all costs,\n- And she wants to rid the world of evil so that what happened to her parents could never happen to another person.\n### Petrified Child\nThe Petrified Child is a [geode god](phenomena/geode-god.md). It was created with the objective to rid the world of evil, but no one knows if the petrified child truly follows the objective morality of the world. With the mind of a baby, its decision making may be skewed.\n\nIt was imprisoned by the Empire of the Petrified Child in their great temple, meaning that it couldn't save them when they fell, and got trapped forever.\n\nIt telepathically speaks in short sentences, always getting to the point, and often lies to reach the easiest conclusion. It is capable of saying different things to different people in the same moment. Its voice is like stones scraping.\n#### Motivations:\n- To rid the world of evil.\n- To be let out.\n### Mossrot\nMossrot, Riverbell's father, is a Minikin. He \\[INSERT SOURCE OF HIS MOTIVATION HERE\\] and became convinced he had to leave normal society and live without magic, removing his [fortuitary gland](phenomena/fortuitary-gland.md). Amassing a cult of followers, he fled with them to the 0th Realm and founded the city of Lichenia.\n\nWhen he became old, he became convinced that magic was the only way to ensure his continued existence. Not only is this true as magic extends one's lifetime, but he also felt as if Riverbell was not ready to be a leader.\n\nHe murdered his wife, Riverblossom, for her fortuitary gland - and underwent partial [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) once he came in contact with its magic after being kept from it for so long. He was transported to the -3rd realm, the most unstable, and became dangerous and insane.\n#### Motivations:\n- To flee a world of magic\n- To live longer for Riverbell, if not forever for his own gain.\n## Story\n### Act 1\n#### Chapter 1\nChapter 1 focuses on [Blueberry](characters/blueberry.md), and begins with him finding himself abandoned in the wilderness of the 0th Realm. He doesn't know how he got there, but he knows who he is - and that he can't return to his home.\n\nHe gets upset, but is calmed when he meets a Minikin called [Toadstool](characters/toadstool.md). Toadstool is a bandit, but tries to hide it out of embarrassment and fear, being cryptic. During their introduction, Blueberry tries to eat a berry Toadstool had as a snack, which is what he gets named after by Toadstool when he cannot pronounce his birth name.\n\nAfter their introduction, the duo subsequently begin to fly over a lake. In the air, Blueberry opens up about what happened, and Toadstool resolves to take him in and give him the home he lacks. When they land, Toadstool creates a gateway to the 2nd Realm, and the two arrive at Amanitaville.\n##### Settings\n- 0th Realm (Main)\n\t- Forest Wilderness\n- 2nd Realm\n- 1st Realm (Mentioned)\n#### Chapter 2\nChapter 2 focusses on Toadstool, and begins with him and Blueberry arriving at the 2nd Realm, at Amanitaville, his hometown. The city is large, vertical, arboreal, and overwhelming. Toadstool tried to comfort Blueberry but is met with apprehension.\n\nMany people stare at the two, the reader doesn't know why, but this is due to Toadstool's reputation. The two walk past a preacher talking about Lichenia, but ignore it. They move onward toward Toadstool's home tree.\n\nAt Toadstool's home tree, the family is gathering around the branches, eating their dinner. Toadstool is continually trying to push the impression that he's a good person and saved this demi-slug, but the family see it for what it is - 'You're only filling the void in mouths to feed after we lost \\[Cousin\\]'\n\nThe conversation at dinner is ripe with tension, and culminates in an all out argument, where Toadstool's backstory is revealed. Blueberry leaves the blueberry he was eating on the tree, and slips away.\n\nReturning to the preacher, Blueberry enquires about the city, and decides to flee there. The chapter ends with Toadstool watching Blueberry as he is given a map to Lichenia and walks through a gateway the preacher had made and enters the 0th Realm forest to find the city.\n\n#### Chapter 3\nChapter 3 focusses on Riverbell, and begins with her waking up to find Blueberry, grizzled and malnourished, a week after the last chapter. He had finally made his way to the city.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["meta"]},"/phenomena/alucinara":{"title":"Alucinara","content":"\n## Overview\nAlucinara is a form of energy created by the [First Judge](lore/creation-story.md) that allows the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) to act in place of the [Second Laws](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md). It creates a variety of effects, known as [**enchantments**, **charms**, or **curses**](phenomena/enchantment.md), and is instrumental in the existence of the Soul.\n\nIt can be absorbed by by Alucinarium to store it, by water to nullify its effect, and by hydrocarbons to create the Soul[^1].\n## Appearance\nAlucinara itself is accompanied by the creation of short-lived orange orbs and sparks nearby. Although it is colourless itself, it often appears as a purple aura - this is due to the purple-shifting of light that passes through its energy fields.\n\nAlucinarium, the mineral in which the energy is stored, appears semi-translucent, dark purple, and shines orange, easily cleaving off into dust. Due to the Alucinara that is stored and emitted from the mineral, it is often accompanied by the orbs, sparks, and purple aura.\n\n%%\n## Effects\nAlucinara causes effects such as;\n- Levitation of objects or living beings, where the effects of gravity will be altered in direction or intensity.\n- essential shift, where an object or living being will be transported into another realm. This is often accomplished by the presence of an [Alucinara Gateway](phenomena/aluicnara-gateway.mc).\n- Emission of light, where an object will emit glowing sparks or orbs which dim over time;\n- The [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle), where inanimate objects will act like living animals;\n- The Soul, where Alucinara will interact with hydrocarbons in pitch or amino acids to create consciousness;\n- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo the growth of alucinarium crystals on the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary essential shift.\n- and [Symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), designs traced into alucinara-rich objects to interface with higher-order beings.\n\n### Influence on Biology\nAlucinara's effect on biology is characterised by growth of unhealthy crystals on the body, extension of an organisms lifetime, and utilisation of the unnatural properties of the energy.\n\nUtilisation of Alucinara has been convergently evolved numerous times in the history of biology, with its basis in the development of the 'Fortuitary Gland' - a gland dedicated to the regulation of alucinarium purity and content in the blood. It often aids the capability of Alucinara use;\n- In sapient species, Alucinara use has similarities to tool use, such as using Alucinara to ignite fires, light areas, and manipulate objects.\n- In less sapient species such as plants, fungus, and most animals (and to a lesser extent, sapient species), Alucinara use is expressed as a biological process. For example, it can be employed in involuntary defence mechanisms, such as bursts of light, to stun predators, or creation of force fields, to push them away.%%\n\n[^1]: Read more at [Darkness](lore/darkness.md)","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["phenomena","alucinara","featured"]},"/phenomena/cloud-gnats":{"title":"Cloud Gnats","content":"## Overview\nCloud Gnats are animal-like apparitions made of [alucinariferous](phenomena/alucinara.md) dust. They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of Alucinara, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.\n\nThey can pose a violent threat, as their crystalline claws or teeth can cause lacerations, infection, and a risk of phantasmarrhoea if a shard of alucinarium were to break off in the wound.\n\n![Cloud Gnat](images/cloud-gnat.png)\n\n## Appearance\nCloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty and purple, with an average length of 22cm. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain Alucinara and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/phenomena/enchantment":{"title":"Enchantment","content":"## Overview\nEnchantment is the term given to the presence of the [First Laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) in a being or item's behaviour. This means that if a being or object is enchanted, it will act strangely, in predictable or unpredictable ways depending on the specific enchantment.\n## Charms and Curses\nDifferent enchantments are divided into two categories, charms and curses. **Charms** are named for their beneficial effects, and **Curses** are named for their detrimental effects.\n### Example: Levitation\nLevitation, for instance, is often termed a charm. This is because levitation provides a convenient effect.\n\nFor example, it allows for the presence of floating stepping stones to connect arboreal walkways, or airships which can carry passengers. In these cases, levitation would be called the Charm of Levitation.\n\nLevitation can also be termed a curse, especially when it is employed on another living being. Levitation can allow one to fly, but it can also allow one to cause another to float against their will. In this case, levitation would be called the Curse of Levitation.\n## Method\nEnchantments can be cast through a variety of means. One method is through [Symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), designs traced into alucinara-rich surfaces to create a specific effect. Another, more common, method is through [spell-casting](phenomena/spell-casting.md).\n### Symbols\nUsing symbols, one can cast a long-lived enchantment. Symbols can enforce enchantments for days on end, until the surface they are traced into runs out of [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md).\n\nFor example, the design of a raindrop (or other wet thing) can be traced into a tree nearby a farm, and this would enforce the Charm of Rain, meaning that crops could be watered during a drought or famine.\n### Spell-casting\nUsing the casting of spells can create more short-lived fleeting enchantments, which only continue for as long as the sorcerer wants them to, or until their Alucinara reserve depletes.\n\nFor example, a sorcerer could outstretch their hand and force pebbles to fly at high speeds toward an aggressor, causing a short-lived expression of the Charm of Acceleration, a charm used to move objects (similar to the Charm of Levitation).","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["enchantment","phenomena","featured"]},"/phenomena/fortuitary-gland":{"title":"Fortuitary Gland","content":"## Overview\nFortuitary glands are glands dedicated to the secretion of [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md), and are integral to the use of Alucinara in biological processes or tools.\n\nIn [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md), they are small, two of them situated underneath the eyes, behind the back of the throat.

If a sky island is claimed by a sapient organism, the underside may be carved into and made to feature walkways or rooms carved into the rockface. However, when the surface is undisturbed, the alucinarium content causes the rock to warp or shift into shapes.\n\n## Formation\nSky islands begin as subterranean alucinarium deposits near the ground surface. The alucinarium eventually may cause the surrounding area to detach from the crust and begin to float.\n\nThe alucinarium content in the rock causes the surface of sky islands to change shape, warping into features such as a face, a carving of a scene, or other small-scale features. In addition, larger-scale features can develop, such as the overall shape of the sky island to warp into the body plan of an animal.\n\nFurthermore, sky islands show a tendancy to take the form animals according to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md). As sky islands float, they may take the form of avian animals such as birds or bats, or may take the form of aquatic animals such as whales or fish.\n\n## Feeding Habits\nWhile sky islands aren't alive, they need to be fed with Alucinara to stay afloat, and hunt alucinariferous animals or plants to refuel according to the pseudo-fauna principle.\n\nA common hunting practice is that the sky islands may be drawn to areas of high-alucinarium content, such as communities of animals or crystalline mountains. They swoop from high altitude  down, and catch any sources of Alucinara in their mouths which shift open as they descend.\n\nIf an animal is eaten, then the alucinarium present in their body will be absorbed into the rock as decomposition takes place. Once all that is left is bone, the bone will be naturally moved deeper into the rock itself as the stone shifts. This can cause high concentrations of calcium in the rock, and this can cause vast large stalagtites of calcium carbonate to form.\n\n## Stalagtites\nThese stalagtites hang from the underside of the sky islands, reaching large sizes. Due to the pseudo-fauna principle, these stalagtites may even warp vaguely into a shape reminiscent of a minikin, an other animal, or trees.\n\n### Spikefalls\nOnce the stalagtites reach a large enough size, they can fall from the sky islands in an event known as a Spikefall. Due to their large mass, wide, dusty, vast craters form once they reach the ground. While a lot of the stalagtite is vapourised on impact, the large scale of them can lead to the more stable inner rock staying intact.\n\nThe more stable rock tends to take a more clarified shape of what the stalagtites were before impact. Whereas a minikinoid stalagtite may have a smooth indistinct surface on the sky island itself, once fallen the exess is broken away and there is left colossal structures at the centre of each crater.\n\n### Stalagtite Communities\nIf found, some craters are converted into communities, cities, or towns. The central structure is commonly the basis of a deity, and these fallen stalagtites are often worshipped by those who live around them.\n\nIn addition, some crater communities carve houses or structures into the fallen stalagtites, creating walkways through the stone and balconies at the side, while others create wooden or clay buildings around the main structure. Some communities do both, and create walkways and/or connections from the carved structures into the external ones.\n\n#### Notable Stalagtite Communities\n- [Cratertown](locations/cratertown.md), a town inhabited by [Dviri](cultures/dviri.md) minikin, built around an indistinct-shaped stalagtite.\n- [City of the Fallen One](locations/city-of-the-fallen-one.md), a religious site of the [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí.md) minikin, built around a minikinoid stalagtite.\n- [Amanitaville](locations/amanitaville.md), the capital of [Morelland](locations/morelland.md), built around a mushroom-shaped stalagtite.\n\n### Notable Sky Islands\n- The Birds,\n\t- Aderyn Major, the largest sky island to record\n\t- and Aderyn Minor;\n- The Bats,\n\t- Ystlum Primus,\n\t- Ystlum Secundus, the most bloodthirsty sky island to record\n\t- and Ystlum Tertius;\n- The Whales,\n\t- Morvilog Major\n\t- and Morvilog Minor, the most peaceful sky island to record;\n- and The Worms,\n\t- Abwyd Primus, the longest sky island to record,\n\t- Abwyd Secundus,\n\t- Abwyd Tertius, the smallest sky island to record\n\t- and Abwyd Quartus.\n\n#### Aderyn Major\nAderyn Major, the largest sky island to record, takes the shape of a bird and has been inhabited by the Nesi and Stonechild Imperial Minikin. Originating from Tseiréph, Aderyn Major has been found and colonised by many central continent peoples.\n\n##### Discovery by the Ǫzí Minikin\nOnce, Aderyn Major crash-landed, having ran out of Alucinara. A group of minikin known as the Ǫzí minikin found Aderyn Major's remains and began to inspect it but, in a turn of tragic fate, one group of minikin entered the mouth of the sky island and tragically died to the ravenous ecosystem inside.\n\nWhen the alucinarium inside of the victims' bodies was released, the sky island took full advantage of this - immediately springing to animation, with the rest of the Ǫzí minikin on its back. It soon began to float upward, taking its place as the home of the Nesi Minikin, who broke off from the Ǫzí.\n\n##### Conquest by the Empire of the Petrified Child\nCenturies later, by the time of the Stonechild Era, the empire had begun to take advantage of their new technology of Alucinara-powered flight. Using an airship of theirs, they attacked the island - burning and pillaging the town of Aderynville and taking control of Birton, claiming it as the capital of their Aderyn Major Province.\n\nFollowing the conquest, two social classes formed, as is usual with stonechild colonialism - the Blue class and the Orange class. The blue class was named for the stonechild officers' blue attire, and the orange class for the remaining Nesi minikin's orange attire.\n\nFor centuries going forward, the Empire of the Petrified Child would control the island, policing entry and exit, taxing the inhabitants, converting them to [Stonechildism](religions/stonechildism.md), and mistreating them. However, once the empire fell, outside resources were scarce - the blues attempted to keep control, convincing themselves that the empire couldn't *truly* be gone, but it was too late.\n\n##### Fall of the Empire\nEventually, the blues formed their own state, not letting themselves succumb to the mounting resistence that was ready to burst in the wake of the political instability of the time. This was what would be known as the [True Sovereign State of Aderyn Major of the Petrified Child](locations/the-aderyn-state.md), often shortened to just 'The Aderyn State.'\n\nA queen was appointed of the highest-ranking officer of the island, beginning a matrilineal line of succession as each generation took the mantle of controlling the island.\n\nAs time went on, the unrest of the island calmed, as the blues became more and more comfortable with feeding dissenters to the belly of the island. However - stonechild influence on the island dimished over time, albeit slowly over centuries.\n\n##### Rise of the Nesi Minikin\nOver time, the class divide grew to become a mere suggestion.

Over time, the surface of the stone may warp to reflect the visage or form of the soul inside.\n## Behaviour\nSoulstones contain the deceased's soul by tricking the [Darkness](deities/the-darkness.md) into believing that the stone is a viable body. This is accomplished through the emulation of organic compounds, due to the presence of Hydrocarbons.\n## Uses\nWithout a soulstone, the soul of a deceased organism will flee to the Pond.\n### To Store the Dead\nSoulstones are used to circumvent this, as they provide a sentimental object to project the life of a relative or loved one onto. They are often kept as decorations to be kept in one's home or mausoleum, or ornaments to be set in object such as furniture, chandeliers, or jewellery.\n### To Summon the Dead\nSoulstones are sometimes used to summon the dead. This can be accomplished by keeping one close during sleep, which allows the deceased's soul to appear within the dreams of those nearby.\n\nIn addition, in the presence of dust, the soul can manifest into a [Cloud Gnat](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md).

They are used to interface with higher-order beings, or as a method of casting [enchantments](phenomena/enchantment.md).\n## Method\nSymbols interface with Higher-Order beings and the First Laws due to the nature of the universe. The universe, having been [created](lore/creation-story.md) as an art piece by the Judges, is heavily connected design and order, meaning that any artwork can spawn strange effects.\n\nThis phenomenon is largely unnoticeable, irrelevant, or has no effects. The most effective way that it can express itself is through intricate designs in the presence of [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md). These designs are termed Symbols.\n## Use\nSome groups, such as the [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin.md) minikin, make use of Symbols. Knowledge of their existence is largely passed down through the generations. Minikin use Symbols by spitting Alucinara-rich saliva[^2] out onto objects and then tracing a design into their surface.\n\nSometimes, some species may add Symbols to their skin using tattoos or controlled scarring. This is done with caution however, as permanent symbols on a living being can be drastically detrimental if the symbol is botched. This is because living beings are rich in [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), and the effect of the Symbol would not cool down and end.\n### Charms and Curses\nThe specific design used can change the effect of the Symbol, allowing for the ability to enchant items and beings with certain [charms or curses](phenomena/enchantment.md). Enchantment isn't exclusive to Symbol use, but Symbols are the only way to cast a great amount of them.\n\nFor example, the charm of levitation can be cast by tracing the shape of a floating object, such as a bird or cloud, into an object, where it will begin to float. The curse of misfortune can be cast by tracing a skull into a boulder or rock, where it will fall over on top of the next person who walks beneath it.\n## Restrictions\nSymbols are restricted by two factors:\n- The durability of the object they are traced into, and\n- The amount of [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) fuelling the Symbol.\n\nThese two factors decide wether or not the symbol breaks apart after continued use and repeated tracing, and how long the effect last for.\n\nAs Alucinarium is used up when it is converted into energy, Symbols don't last forever, they last until their Alucinara reserve is refilled. Settlement Councils generally maintain the reserves of charmed objects when they are integral to the infrastructure of a given community or civilisation.\n\n## Effectiveness\nIn addition, the effectiveness of Symbols is also a factor. That is, the overall strength of the effect generated and length that it continues for.\n\nEffectiveness is affected by the shape of the Symbol, certain features such consistency in shape and visual cohesiveness can affect how well a Symbol behaves. Sorcerers receive training in the technique of creating symbols, being taught the motifs that seem to please reality the most.\n\n[^1]: Read more at [Watchstones](phenomena/symbols/watchstones.md).\n[^2]: Read more at [The Fortuitary Gland](phenomena/fortuitary-gland.md).","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["phenomena","alucinara","featured"]},"/phenomena/watchstones":{"title":"Watchstones","content":"\n## Overview\nWatchstones ([Sarvaran](languages/sarvaran.md): 'The Seeing Stones,' Oį́n Eyą́nith Atį́mar \u003c `*uinh eyanitu atëmil`) are artificial patrols invented by the [Sarvaran](groups/sarvaran-civilisation.md) minikin for the purpose of giving [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) a greater visual range. They are rocks with eyes or faces carved into them, commonly made from [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) geodes. They served as one of the first examples of mass-production by the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md).\n\nWatchstones with the ability to move imprint on the closest animal, observing to see if the animal carries out an evil action or an evil action is carried out against it. Due to their animalistic behaviour as defined by the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), Watchstones with the ability to move are often taken as pets or companions in spite of their lack of a soul.\n\n![Watchstone](images/watchstone.png)\n\n## Utility\nWatchstones are given use by the presence of eyes on the surface of rock as the petrified child has the ability to see out of every pair of eyes carved or eroded into rock formations. This is the mechanism which the petrified child uses to detect evil.\n\nBefore watchstones began to be carved out of geodes, they were motionless and static despite their effectiveness. This meant a lot of watchstones would be hidden away in pockets as a good luck charm, but this proved ineffective. This led to the cutting of holes into pockets and the specific fabrication of places such as lockets and cases to place watchstones within; this allowed watchstones to serve their purpose more effectively.\n\nThey are often given other facial features in addition to their eyes, this practice began as artistic chiselling by the sarvaran minikin but eventually proved to increase the effectiveness and field of view of watchstones, becoming the standard by the time of the Empire of the petrified child.\n\n## Appearance\nWatchstones have the appearance of a chiselled pair of eyes / a face upon a hard rock or pebble. When carved from alucinarium geodes, watchstones can additionally feature an internal orange glow visible from the thinner parts of the surface.\n\nIn addition, they can feature physically separate 'legs' used to aid the process of floatation; large rocks or geodes form the main bodies of watchstones, and smaller alucinariferous pebbles form the legs.\n\n### Legs\nThese legs are made of pebbles taken from the ground, continually picked up with magic and put down when their inherent Alucinara has been used up. They aid the process of floatation in that, being in contact with the ground, they can act as leverage against the force of gravity. This means that less Alucinara is used up by the watchstone, and continuous floatation is sustainable.\n\n### Pebbles\nPebbles continually accumulate alucinarium over time due to Alucinara present in the air, and lose their Alucinara when in use by watchstones. This is why legs are discarded and fall over after a period of use, and why new ones are naturally picked up.\n\nIn some areas, the amount of energy is negligible, but in others - such as next to a crystalline alucinarium deposit - pebbles can become greatly saturated with the mineral to the point of geode formation; they are taken as legs at the mid-point of this process.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["petrified-child","pseudo-fauna","symbol","featured"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct0":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 0","content":"# Demi-Slugs\nI want demislugs to be small, stocky, creatures. They will be mollusks descended from earth slugs, and live in the 1st realm.\n\n## Diet\nDemi-Slugs are largely herbivorous, and eat primarily leaves, berries, nuts, and bark. However, when desparate, they will definitely turn to small bugs, grubs, and worms for food. they abstain from eating mollusks as a cultural taboo.\n\n## Culture\nthe demi slugs are not as zealous for the petrified child compared to the minikin, but will create watchstones. they don't believe in the petrified child, but have their own analogous deity which takes advantage of the same natural phenomena as the petrified child and watchstones.\n\n## Clothing\nI would like demislugs to have pointy potato-sack-like clothes made out of silk and leaves, they will also have an armour plate on their chests to cover their pneumostomes, usually made out of ivory, bone, or other hard materials. they will also have a symbol traced into them, perhaps the face of a watchstone or a symbol made to bless their health, luck, or harvest.\n\nThey tan leaves for use in clothing, taking the most hydrated leaves from trees for immediate use in tanneries, and eventually in clothing.\n\n## Pastoralism\nDemi slugs exhibit pastoralism in that they farm and herd a small marsupial animals known as the Silkmole.\n### Silkmoles\nSilkmoles are small marsupial creatures native to the 1st realm. they are fossorial, living in the ground, and grow silk for their coats in the winter.\n\nThey were eventually domesticated by the demislugs because they would dig their way into demi-slug colonies so much, and were eventually given their own rooms and enclosures where they could be fed and breed for teh benefit of both parties, the moles and the slugs.\n\n## Clothing\ndue to the silkmoles' production of silk, the demislugs would often shave them during the winter or pick up their shed silk in the spring, and it eventually became evident that it would benefit the demi-slugs to weave the silk into thread that could be used for their clothing.\n\nthe demi-slugs initially kept their clothes together in one piece through the use of plant stems, tying leaf stems togeth er around their necks and waists; but eventually, they gained access to silk and weaving through the silkmoles. this revolutionised the clothing of demi-slugs, from what were merely brown leaf skirts and capes, became a host of clothijng items that the demi-slugs could use.\n\nFor example, they would now sew together tanned leaves with the silkmole thread, and hang their pneumostome armour over their chest with thick silken rope.\n\nThe heads of demi-slugs are covered with a piece of cloth with a hole cut out for the face, with the top edge left uncut as to allow for a flap to go over the face. the mouth is given enough room to eat effectively, and the eyestalks are given the slit as room to poke out of the clothing. The presence of cloth-to-skin contact maximises marmth, a valuable commodity when living a cold, damp, semi-sub-terranean lifestyle, which is fly the flap is needed.\n## Religious Clothing\nDemi-slug religious leaders don't wear the pneumostome armour, due to their unwavering trust in their gods. WHile it is not selfish to wear the armour, it is definitely seen as more humble and respectable to forsake such a vital piece of clothing.\n\nSome religious leaders in higher positions don't wear clothing over the pneumostome at all, showing the most vulnerable part of their body on display, trusting the gods wholly not to curse them by getting it damaged.\n\n## Natural Predators\nThe main predator of demi-slugs is the featherfly, an avian species originating in the 1st realm. Not abiding by earthen biology, they are a large insectoid species with an exoskeleton and a circular ray of feathers atop their back used to glide; [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) provides lift.\n\n## Pantheon\n### The Blind Mole\nThe Blind Mole is analogous to the Petrified Child of Morellic theology. Its cultural perception is influenced by the same deific phenomena that the petrified child is a part of, but doesn't serve as serious a role in the pantheon compared to in the morellic religion.\n\nInfluenced by the presence of moles in demi-slug society, the cultural perception of the petrified child shifted from recognising the stone swaddle as a swaddle toward being \n\n### The Divine Featherfly\nIn demi-slug religion, the divine featherfly is the main, and most important deity. influenced by early stories of the Second Judge of the Universe, the stories of creation were eventually remapped onto the physical visage of Featherflies, due to their salience and great ability to destroy.\n\nThe symbol used to interface with the divine featherfly is that of a featherfly standing atop the planet, and their use in iconography and in designs can bless a location, object, or person, to have greater luck in their endeavours. the use of the planet in the symbol is the feature that gives it power, and teh featherfly is only belueved to have an effect due to culture.\n\nThe symbol was given power when the second judge was destroyed and turned itself into goodness as a natural law; using the symbol increases the probability of goodness, essentially meaning that a featherfly symbol a good luck charm.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["ct"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct1":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 1","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n## Overview\nThis note will be exploring the history of the Minikin, more generally of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md).

The Oloyiru dynasty is matriarchal, spearheaded by a queen; the eldest daughter (or child) of the previous monarch.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144906.png)\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin are a northern nomadic tribe native to Tseiréph (north of the lakes), containing many separate groups and communities, connected by a single Móra riSéwi culture and shared respect. They travel from place to place, riding on the backs of domesticated Weasels, foraging for food, exploring, looking for treasure, and sleeping in leaf hammocks.\n\nThere is a diaspora of nomadic Móra riSéwi minikin living as a community in Naíru, who settled after the leader of their group fell ill and needed medical help in the city; the minikin haven't left since the leader was rendered bedridden there in a tree-shelter.\n\n## Events\n### Móra riSéwi minikin discover the Tree\nOne day in the early autumn, the Móra riSéwi leader Carsai was foraging for food with her group. They found a clearing in a forest, and discovered a lone tree in the centre, surrounded by tar pits and dead bushes, with a quaint footpath of stones leading to an island in the midst of the tar-swamp.\n\nIt was almost perfect, a footpath and island lit up by sunlight in the middle of a dark forest, and naturally the party came to the centre and discovered that the tree was hollow and thin; you could push you arm through the tree and it could come out of the other end without any resistance.\n\nNonetheless, the would go back to its original shape soon after being disturbed, it appeared as if its components lacked gravity and the only force of nature affecting it was the need to be in one piece. Carsai ripped the tree open however, and was exposed to the ancient dust and fumes within, which poured out like a solid cloud.\n\nWhen the dust cleared and as Carsai held the tree open, her group grasped at the items within the trunk. The items within were shimmering, iridescent and gold, in the shape of acorns, loaves of bread, and small dead animals - none was decomposed, all was perfectly preserved and an instinct within the party told them that it was edible.\n\nOnce the group collected the items in baskets, and the tree closed up once more, they returned to their camp site and unloaded the goods into their hammocks and bags. Carsai was the first to eat the gold food, and almost immediately began coughing; the same fumes and dust that had poured out of the tree was pouring from her mouth and nose, and her eyes turned the same colour as the gas.\n\nThe group didn't know what to do, but only stood back in fear. Soon, however, Carsai seemingly went back to normal, and the group decided quickly to dump the items back into the tree. But by the time they returned to the island, the clearing was empty, no tar swamp, no tree, only grass and bushes. In fear they laid down their baskets onto the floor and left the gold food there, and fled immediately.\n\n### Carsai falls ill\nSoon after however, Carsai's condition became more and more unstable. She would break into fits of coughing out the fumes, but would soon go back to normal, just as when she first ate the gold food. Eventually, she was unable to lead effectively, and the group resigned themselves to Naíru for her to recover; Naíru had very good healthcare.\n\nEventually, after a period of a few months to a year, Carsai became bedridden, and was unable to leave her dormitory den in the city. Soon after she entered the state, her compatriots developed her symptoms, and even the native Naíruans did.\n\n### Ykutru and many die\nNot long after the symptoms appeared in the populus, they died, turning hollow with a thin surface, their sorry bodies disappearing when no one was looking. Carsai didn't die, her strength as a leader was matched by her strength as a body, and she was hanging on by a thread, still encouraging her compatriots.\n\nIn addition, Ykutru also died; Ykutru was the twin sister of the co-regnant Ajun, they were the two deformed twin queens of the city at the time. Ajun was horrified; her city, her twin sister, all gone. Not only this, but also the magical implications.\n\nTwins share one soul, but the [magic energy](phenomena/alucinara.md) contained within the soul is enough to fill two bodies. When one twin dies, the other is filled to overflowing with magic energy (enough for two people); most twins die when this happens, undergoing the [curse of phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md), some some are strong enough to resist. Unfortunately, the side effects still include insanity, violent irritability, and sometimes partial phantasmarrhoea.\n\nAjun was now a husk of her former self, she lost almost everything, her mind, her sister, a portion of her population, but she still had her power - she still had the ability to order people to make things right. The almost immediately ordered the eradication of the sick, and feared for her own health - she resigned herself to only wearing layers upon layers of armours and fabrics to shield herself from the fumes, despite the fact she lived in the royal tree where any of the fumes would simply sink to the ground.\n\n### Carsai dies\nEventually, Carsai did die, but not to the illness she contracted and the plague that caused all of the havoc. Ajun had heard the rumours of Carsai's 'guilt,' that she was Patient 0 and in her insnaity blamed her for every wrong thing. She left her royal tree to climb up Carsai's; Ajun killed her in cold blood, in front of the entire group.\n\nLittle did she know, the Móra riSéwi were a very spiritual tribe, and had knowledge of how to interface with deities, and there was one of many [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) staring directly at the queen.\n\n### The Petrified Child destroys Ajun\nThe petrified child, knowing immediately of the evil that had took place before one of its 'eyes,' made a bee line from its dwelling place to the city of Naíru. Ajun didn't stand a chance against the child's perfect judgement; she and her guards to tried to fend the child off were swiftly turned into baby sludge.\n\nA baby meadow was formed from the evil and corruption, political and literal, of the royalty. The city finally fell, cast into chaos. Whosoever wasn't killed by Carsai's plague, was lost to the baby sludge, and those who were further away were either trampled or died in some other fashion in the chaos of people attempting to escape.\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin eventually managed to escape, with many causalities to the petrified child and to the plague already. Carsai's eldest daughter, Bjáura, was rendered queen immediately and, taking after her mother, led the group to safety with authority and confidence. They fled for the west, reaching the coast, and camped there with their nomadic skills and instincts until they had built enough boats and rafts out of sticks and vegetation to sail southwest across the Sarvaran gulf.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809145007.png)\n\nOn the journey, many died of dehydration and starvation, but they rationed the food they had gathered near the coast and threw overboard anyone who showed a symptom; they were successful in eradicating the plague from their own population, and only had to hope it wouldn't show up where they were sailing.\n\n### Founding of Sarvara\nOnce they reached land, on the south-eastern coast of the Sarvaran gulf, they founded the city of Sarvara; Bjáura was the first queen. There were native Austerkin minikin in the area, which responded in many ways to the newcomers. A lot took pity on them, noting their starving bodies and desperate (if incomprehensible and foreign-language) explanations of what had happened.\n\nSome of the natives treated them well, feeding them and helping them, but some saw them as a threat and began to war with them. The natives who had treated the Móra riSéwi minikin well were let into their new city-state, given hospitality as they had given them.\n\n#### Castes\nSarvara developed a caste system, with the 'Native' and the 'Móra riSéwi' castes emerging. As the two groups interbred, the castes were handed down matrilineally, but the genetic makeup of the two groups evened out as time went along, leading to the creation of the Sarvaran race, made up of a hybrid of the Móra riSéwi and Austerkin races. A new name was fashioned for the Sarvaran group, the *Morellic* minikin.\n\n### The Tsañána Minikin\nThe warring natives, however, were ostracised, and had their tails cut off at the first chance by the Móra riSéwi Morellic minikin; their tribe was titled 'oįn ųréderrith ųdáląn'gir,' and their land 'oįn udalą́n'gur ųnę́n'gil,' meaning 'the aggressive southerners' and 'the land of agression'. They were noticeable for their retention of native Austerkin characteristics, namely hairiness and their native language, 'oįn adhéill ųnrédeir'.

The Oyhólıru dynasty is matriarchal, spearheaded by a queen; the eldest daughter (or child) of the previous monarch.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144906.png)\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin are a northern nomadic tribe native to Tseiréph (north of the lakes), containing many separate groups and communities, connected by a single Móra riSéwi culture and shared respect. They travel from place to place, riding on the backs of domesticated Weasels, foraging for food, exploring, looking for treasure, and sleeping in leaf hammocks.\n\nThere is a diaspora of nomadic Móra riSéwi minikin living as a community in Naíru, who settled after the leader of their group fell ill and needed medical help in the city; the minikin haven't left since the leader was rendered bedridden there in a tree-shelter.\n-\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin used to be nomadic, but settled in Naíru after their leader caught a strange plague. as this plague spread, one of the queens died, and her sister went mad and killed the Móra riSéwi leader, which triggered the petrified child to destroy a portion of the royal district with a baby meadow.\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin fled the city, migrating southeast across the Sarvaran gulf on rafts, and eventually settled in an area inhabited by Austerkin minikin. In an attempt to settle down and get some stability once more, they mingled with some of the natives and founded the city-state of Sarvara, becoming the Morellic minikin as they interbred with the new people they met.\n\nSome of the natives disliked the newcomers, not bothering to learn their language and choosing to go to battle with them over the resources native to the land. One group of these, the most violent, was the Tsanyana minikin, but there were also two other groups, which interacted with the Morellic minikin in different ways.\n\nIn addition, the Morellic minikin had to take advantage of the new land they found themselves in, unfamiliar with the native animals and fauna, but eventually grew to domesticate an array of fauna and flora.\n## Events\n### Móra riSéwi minikin discover the Tree\nOne day in the early autumn, the Móra riSéwi leader Carsai was foraging for food with her group. They found a clearing in a forest, and discovered a lone tree in the centre, surrounded by tar pits and dead bushes, with a quaint footpath of stones leading to an island in the midst of the tar-swamp.\n\nIt was almost perfect, a footpath and island lit up by sunlight in the middle of a dark forest, and naturally the party came to the centre and discovered that the tree was hollow and thin; you could push you arm through the tree and it could come out of the other end without any resistance.\n\nNonetheless, the would go back to its original shape soon after being disturbed, it appeared as if its components lacked gravity and the only force of nature affecting it was the need to be in one piece. Carsai ripped the tree open however, and was exposed to the ancient dust and fumes within, which poured out like a solid cloud.\n\nWhen the dust cleared and as Carsai held the tree open, her group grasped at the items within the trunk. The items within were shimmering, iridescent and gold, in the shape of acorns, loaves of bread, and small dead animals - none was decomposed, all was perfectly preserved and an instinct within the party told them that it was edible.\n\nOnce the group collected the items in baskets, and the tree closed up once more, they returned to their camp site and unloaded the goods into their hammocks and bags. Carsai was the first to eat the gold food, and almost immediately began coughing; the same fumes and dust that had poured out of the tree was pouring from her mouth and nose, and her eyes turned the same colour as the gas.\n\nThe group didn't know what to do, but only stood back in fear. Soon, however, Carsai seemingly went back to normal, and the group decided quickly to dump the items back into the tree. But by the time they returned to the island, the clearing was empty, no tar swamp, no tree, only grass and bushes. In fear they laid down their baskets onto the floor and left the gold food there, and fled immediately.\n\n### Carsai falls ill\nSoon after however, Carsai's condition became more and more unstable. She would break into fits of coughing out the fumes, but would soon go back to normal, just as when she first ate the gold food. Eventually, she was unable to lead effectively, and the group resigned themselves to Naíru for her to recover; Naíru had very good healthcare.\n\nEventually, after a period of a few months to a year, Carsai became bedridden, and was unable to leave her sleep den in the city. Soon after she entered the state, her compatriots developed her symptoms, and even the native Naíruans did.\n\n### Ykutru and many die\nNot long after the symptoms appeared in the populus, they died, turning hollow with a thin surface, their sorry bodies disappearing when no one was looking. Carsai didn't die, her strength as a leader was matched by her strength as a body, and she was hanging on by a thread, still encouraging her compatriots.\n\nIn addition, Ykutru also died; Ykutru was the twin sister of the co-regnant Ajun, they were the two deformed twin queens of the city at the time. Ajun was horrified; her city, her twin sister, all gone. Not only this, but also the magical implications.\n\nTwins share one soul, but the [magic energy](phenomena/alucinara.md) contained within the soul is enough to fill two bodies. When one twin dies, the other is filled to overflowing with magic energy (enough for two people); most twins die when this happens, undergoing the [curse of phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md), some some are strong enough to resist. Unfortunately, the side effects still include insanity, violent irritability, and sometimes partial phantasmarrhoea.\n\nAjun was now a husk of her former self, she lost almost everything, her mind, her sister, a portion of her population, but she still had her power - she still had the ability to order people to make things right. The almost immediately ordered the eradication of the sick, and feared for her own health - she resigned herself to only wearing layers upon layers of armours and fabrics to shield herself from the fumes, despite the fact she lived in the royal tree where any of the fumes would simply sink to the ground.\n\n### Carsai dies\nEventually, Carsai did die, but not to the illness she contracted and the plague that caused all of the havoc. Ajun had heard the rumours of Carsai's 'guilt,' that she was Patient 0 and in her insnaity blamed her for every wrong thing. She left her royal tree to climb up Carsai's; Ajun killed her in cold blood, in front of the entire group.\n\nLittle did she know, the Móra riSéwi were a very spiritual tribe, and had knowledge of how to interface with deities, and there was one of many [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) staring directly at the queen.\n\n### The Petrified Child destroys Ajun\nThe petrified child, knowing immediately of the evil that had took place before one of its 'eyes,' made a bee line from its dwelling place to the city of Naíru. Ajun didn't stand a chance against the child's perfect judgement; she and her guards to tried to fend the child off were swiftly turned into baby sludge.\n\nA baby meadow was formed from the evil and corruption, political and literal, of the royalty. The city finally fell, cast into chaos. Whosoever wasn't killed by Carsai's plague, was lost to the baby sludge, and those who were further away were either trampled or died in some other fashion in the chaos of people attempting to escape.\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin eventually managed to escape, with many causalities to the petrified child and to the plague already. Carsai's eldest daughter, Bjáura, was rendered queen immediately and, taking after her mother, led the group to safety with authority and confidence. They fled for the west, reaching the coast, and camped there with their nomadic skills and instincts until they had built enough boats and rafts out of sticks and vegetation to sail southwest across the Sarvaran gulf.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809145007.png)\n\nOn the journey, many died of dehydration and starvation, but they rationed the food they had gathered near the coast and threw overboard anyone who showed a symptom; they were successful in eradicating the plague from their own population, and only had to hope it wouldn't show up where they were sailing.\n\n### Founding of Sarvara\nOnce they reached land, on the south-eastern coast of the Sarvaran gulf, they founded the city of Sarvara; Bjáura was the first queen. There were native Austerkin minikin in the area, which responded in many ways to the newcomers. A lot took pity on them, noting their starving bodies and desperate (if incomprehensible and foreign-language) explanations of what had happened.\n\nSome of the natives treated them well, feeding them and helping them, but some saw them as a threat and began to war with them. The natives who had treated the Móra riSéwi minikin well were let into their new city-state, given hospitality as they had given them.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144929.png)\n\n#### Castes\nSarvara developed a caste system, with the 'Native' and the 'Móra riSéwi' castes emerging. As the two groups interbred, the castes were handed down matrilineally, but the genetic makeup of the two groups evened out as time went along, leading to the creation of the Sarvaran race, made up of a hybrid of the Móra riSéwi and Austerkin races. A new name was fashioned for the Sarvaran group, the *Morellic* minikin.\n\n### The Tsañána Minikin\nThe warring natives, however, were ostracised, and had their tails cut off at the first chance by the Móra riSéwi military. They were noticeable for their retention of native Austerkin characteristics, namely hairiness and their native language. They stayed in their own city-states, treating the Morellic natives with suspicion and the non-native Morellic minikin with outright prejudice.\n\nTheir nation is to the south of Sarvara, and they are an Un Ntúğa tribe. Following the arrival of the Morellic minikin, they made their own name, to differentiate themselves from the newcomers, and dubbed themselves the 'Tsañána,' meaning 'true people,' as opposed to the Öpfádṛh or Morellic minikin.\n### The Öpfádṛh Minikin\nThe Öpfádṛh minikin are an Austerkin tribe situated to the west of Sarvara, they are closely related to the Tsañána minikin, but don't share their warlike habits; they rather see the Morellic minikin as unimportant and generally tend to trade items within themselves, uninterested in interactions with other tribes.\n\nBeing related to the Tsañána minikin, they are similarly a part of the larger 'Un Ntúğa' group.\n### The Un Ntúğa Minikin\n'Un Ntúğa' Minikin is the title given to the family of Öpfádṛh and Tsañána minikin. Un Ntúğa wasn't a tribe by the time the Morellic minikin arrived, but rather a cladistic title given to both groups who share a common ancestry. However, it used to be a tribe before.\n\nThe late Un Ntúğa tribe was a very large tribe, spanning an area southwest and south of the Sarvaran gulf. They were so large in fact, that two subgroups began to form within them and diverge due to lack of interaction, despite sharing a similar culture.\n\nThe Öpfádṛh group existed to the west, and Tsañána the east; this tribal division was set in stone once the Morellic minikin arrived, as the Tsañána minikin grew angry and jealous of their use and abuse to the local resources, and even angrier at their sibling group for not caring.\n\nOnce the tribal division was laid, and the Tsañána became more and more warlike in a time of political unrest, they began to war with not only the Morellic minikin but also the Öpfádṛh, seeing their small cultural differences as evil and unnatural diversions from *true* tradition, that they weren't *true* people, like the Tsañána.\n### The Kaśtai̋ra Minikin\nThe Kaśtaïra minikin are a Śutéäqṇ minikin tribe situated to the east of Sarvara. They used to be one with the native Morellic minikin, but naturally and uneventfully diverged as the cultural differences grew larger and the western Śutéäqṇ minikin became more and more interested in being incorporated into Morellic society.\n\nThe eastern Kaśtai̋ra were largely disinterested with joining the tribe due to their geographic distance and western-cultural disinterest, but they rather saw the Morellic minikin as a valuable friend, a 'sister in law' on a kind of national scale of sorts, and grew to have a healthy trade relationship with the new tribe.\n### The Śutéäqṇ Minikin\nSimilar to the Un Ntúğa minikin, the Śutéäqṇ minikin is a late tribe and modern grouping of tribes; The Śutéäqṇ minikin contain the Kaśtai̋ra minikin as well as the Morellic minikin, in that the native portion of Morellic genetics is traced back to the Śutéäqṇ tribe.\n\nThe Kaśtai̋ra minikin split off from the native Morellic minikin a while before the non-native Morellic minikin arrived, in fact. They had grew to naturally split, the Kaśtai̋ra being to the east-most portion of the Śutéäqṇ territory and the native Morellic minikin being on the border with the former border of the Tsañána.\n\nAs the Móra riSéwi minikin arrived, the tribal division was reinforced with the western Śutéäqṇ minikin being subsumed into the Morellic tribe, and the Kaśtai̋ra tribe eventually became its own solid separate group following the development out of the Śutéäqṇ tribe.\n\n## Morellic Trade Relationships\nThe Morellic Minikin, living in Sarvara and neighbouring villages, have a lot of their own resources and need a lot of foreign resources. For example, the Morellic minikin lack fair-weed plant fibre, lapis alucinarii, and wormpigs in the area they had settled; and all of these things are found in the areas inhabited by the Morellic peoples' neighbours.\n### To the Tsañána\nTrade with the Tsañána is almost non-existent through official means, and no Tsañána ruler in their right might would ever let the Morellic minikin trade with their subjects. However, there is a black market between the two groups, where trade is acceptable, encouraged, and illegal.\n\nThe Morellic minikin import lapis alucinarii from the Tsañána area, illegally buying it for great amounts for use in royal temples and high-class architecture, where money can be spent and appearances are valuable; lapis alucinarii is a beautiful mineral made of alucinarium with gold veins travelling through it; it is commonly used by the Morellic minikin in ornamentation and spiritual idols.\n\nTrade *from* the Morellic minikin to the Tsañána minikin was quite different however; a lot of the resources that the Tsañána felt was stolen from them was largely stolen by the Tsañána armies, and not traded.\n### To the Öpfádṛh\nTrade with the Öpfádṛh was mainly for their animals, the ecosystem cultivated and helped by the Öpfádṛh was very fruitful and led to great wealth among the group. They export various livestock animals to the Morellic minikin, sending them wormpigs, quartz-mice (imported from the [-2nd Realm](locations/-2nd-realm.md)), and many other livestock animals that are non-native to the Sarvaran area.\n\nThe Morellic export to the Öpfádṛh things such as Silklet nests, silklet silk, and fabric. There is an abundance of silklets in Sarvara, which are domesticated, farmed, and sold to the west, leading to a vibrant Silklet husbandry industry within Sarvara.\n### To the Kaśtai̋ra\nThe Kaśtai̋ra minikin export fair-weed plant fibre to the Morellic minikin; due to the different habitat afforded to the Kaśtai̋ra minikin, fair-weed grows a lot more abundantly and in a lot better quality compared to Sarvara and the surrounding area. Fair-weed fibre is woven into royal garments, appearing with a light-yellow colour when not dyed.\n\nThe Morellic minikin export to the Kaśtai̋ra animals such as Weasels. Weasels are used by the minikin of the area as cavalry, they are a common sight on the Morello-Tsañána battlefield. Weasels are essentially only native to the Morellic and Tsañána area.\n\nThe Morellic minikin farm and sell weasels to the Kaśtai̋ra among other groups at points, but the Tsañána are very stingy with their weasels and tend to train them only for battle and never allow themselves to lose even one valuable weasel. \n\nEven so, weasels are very expensive and the Morellic weasel farmers are very rich for their products, listing them for high prices due to their importance to the military and the great danger a minikin puts themselves in to train a weasel for domestic or military use.\n\n## Animals of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md)\n## Weasels\nWeasels are essentially the same in the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md) as in the 0th, originating from the Supernova of 80MB, but since then have developed an extra pair of legs with the help of alucinarium and a greater ability to leap. They are domesticated by Minikin for use in battle, as they would usually hunt minikin.\n\nMinikin, being smart, noticed this, and began to weaponise them against their neighbours, eventually training them and treating them as pets once the aggression was bred out of them by skilled pastoralists. Now, they are largely used as cavalry in the military.\n\nOne or two minikin soldiers will sit upon a weasel's back, supported by the 3rd pair of legs, and charge at the enemy, holding spears in their hands or using [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) to levitate daggers and sharp objects forward into the enemy, like a spear or arrow.\n\nIt is an iconic sight to see a soldier or two sitting upon a weasels back, with only a rug-like cloth separating the rider from its steed, with an array of levitating darts above the rider's head floating in an arc, ready to be shot forward in a burst of magic.\n\nSoldiers will typically hold both hands out, facing upward, to direct the magic to the daggers, flicking their hand forward to signal the darts to fire. Soldiers undergo training to increase their Alucinarium Reserve, and to resist the effects of Phantasmarrhoea.\n## Silklets\nSilklets are a type of insect native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), more specifically to places such as the Morellic area. IN their larval stage, they take the form of relatively large grubs, wriggling and being fed by farmers in specialised shelters made out of clay under tree branches.\n\nBefore they become adults, they continually grow a fleece of silk, which is shaved by farmers and sold to weavers. Once they do become adults, a portion of them are set aside to mate by the farmers if they had an especially fruitful coat as a larva. The majority, however, are killed and fed to Wormpigs once they reach adulthood and no longer produce silk.\n\nThey appear as large dragonflies as adults, and appear as large featureless grubs as larvae.\n## Wormpigs\nWormpigs are a species native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), more specifically to places such as the Öpfádṛh area, related to the wormwolves of the -3rd. Unlike their vicious carnivorous cousins, wormpigs are rather very docile and mostly herbivorous, and were eventually domesticated by the minikin for their meat as a livestock animal.\n\nIt is a common sight to see a wormpig farm at the foot of a Minikin's tree, with the wormpigs grazing and being fed with food such as leaves and bark dropped by farmers from the branches.\n\nWormpigs are actually not one organism, but two, with a symbiote organism constituting the legs, essentially, and a worm-like host organism that sits atop the back of the symbiote, using its legs for movement and paying it back in nutrition and everything it needs to survive, with a strong organic adhesive connecting the two creatures and highly vascularised and permeable tissue allowing for diffusion of compounds between the organisms.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["ct"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct3":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 3","content":"%%\nWhat will we be doing in this note?\nWhat things are important to be mentioned and affect the evevnts?\nHow do the events happen, and what influences them?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nIn this note, we will be describing the specifics of Sarvara, its rise, its features, and its politics. \n\n## Notes\n- \n- \n- \n\n## Context\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin migrated southeast from the northwest of the sarvaran gulf following the plague in Naíru, started by their former leader Carsai. Carsai died and her eldest daughter Bjáura was appointed queen, just before the migration.\n\nOnce they reached land, they began to interact with the natives who all responded in different ways to their presence. the western Kaśtaïra were subsumed into the Móra riSéwi tribe, becoming the Morellic tribe as time went on. \n## Events\n## The Móra riSéwi Minikin Arrive\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin arrived on the shore of the Sarvaran gulf, frantically running into the wilderness at the final sight of land. Then they met the local natives nearby, the western Kaśtaïra minikin, who gave them hospitality.\n\nRunning and screaming in a foreign language, the Móra riSéwi minikin were taken into the western Kaśtaïra trees, dens, and villages, set about fires and finally given a moment to relax, eat, and attempt to explain the situation in their indecipherable tongue.\n\n### The Counsel of Móra riSéwi Refuge\nAs the situation became apparent, the matriarchs of the western Kaśtaïra clans all came together to discuss the matter. They accepted the Móra riSéwi minikin in on the condition that they would be cast out by the time they built their own villages, as not to burden their tribe with another group to feed.\n\nIn addition, the matriarchs also decreed that the Móra riSéwi minikin should be taught how to build cities, as their nomadic tradition only passed down the knowledge of building temporary bases, not built to last. In fact, it was the Kaśtaïra minikin who taught the Móra riSéwi how to build clay dens, by showing them how to find clay and store it in their cheeks.\n## Interbreeding into the Morellic People\nAs the Móra riSéwi minikin settled down in the western Kaśtaïra villages, they naturally began to interbreed and intermarry into the native populations. Continually, every year or so, the matriarchs would convene once more to discuss the Móra riSéwi's progress, and asses whether it was time to drive them out.\n### The Móra riSéwi Language\nKnowing that they were to be driven out at some point, the matrilineally Móra riSéwi minikin retained knowledge of their language, and it wasn't subsumed by the native Kaśtaïra language although a lot of loanwords were gained.\n\n### The Departure of the Móra riSéwi Minikin\nOnce the matriarchs decided it was time for the Móra riSéwi minikin to leave, they had ultimately kained their knowledge of how to found a city not through being taught but through interbreeding into the population; their ability was defined by the fact that they were now partially native to a society that *isn't* nomadic.\n\nAnd once it was time to be driven out, there was no ostracism. A lot of people had the claim to stay, being (partially or completely) native, but a lot of Móra riSéwi minikin had so much respect for the matriarchs and for recent history that they did decide to leave and found their own city to preserve the Móra riSéwi legacy.\n\nThe ones to depart became the Morellic minikin, a cultural and genetic merge of the settlers and the native Kaśtaïra minikin, who gained their own more distinct cultural identity once they left and settled in Sarvara.\n\n## The Search for Sarvara\nWhen the Móra riSéwi minikin had arrived, they arrived close by to the great river Abhmýra. This river, situated in the midst of a very beautiful river valley, was talked about quite a lot once they had settled in the Kaśtaïra settlements. Of course, these stories were relayed to the migrators' children, and gained a semi-mythical status.\n\nSo of course, when it was time to leave, the new Morellic minikin left for the river valley. Having heard stories of the location first hand from their parents, uncorrupted by such a short time-span, they knew the way to get there and employed a lot of knowledge of the area as Kaśtaïra descendants to find it.\n\n## The Founding of Sarvara\nEventually, they did. After a few months march across the wilderness, the matriarch of the Morellic minikin, Kallaśí daughter of Bjáura, found the Sarvaran river valley with her tribe. They named the settlement and the river 'Sarvara,' meaning 'Our River' in Old Morellic, referring to their inherent entitlement to the area as the ones who mythologised and found it.\n\nThe valley, very green, in a largely dry steppe, exhibited the sparkling blue colour of the very wide river with a large eyot in the centre; the eyot featured a large tree in the centre, the tree told in the stories. Knowing the river was very conducive for fertile soil, they almost immediately leaped upon the banks and collected clay for their tree-dens.\n\nKallaśí's servants, especially the Kaśtaïran architects, also immediately pounced upon the large tree at their queen's order and began to build dens, platforms, and rooms fit for royalty upon the tree's nooks and branches. The tree was adored with beautiful clay den architecture, gemstones, and magical implements to increase the awe that the royal tree (a palace, essentially) provided.\n### Its Development\nThe development of Sarvara was greatly accelerated by the continual flooding of the Sarvara river. The minikin would build their supply dens in the trees, same with their sleeping dens, and packed clay down onto the upside of the branches to provide smooth walkways. They also added bridges, stairs, and magical floating stepping stones across the branches and trees through the air to increase accessibility.\n\nThey made a point not to build directly upon the floor where the flood could damage their stores, and only built their farms and sowed their crops within the reach of the flood. Preceding the flood season, they would sow their crops, and after the flood season they would harvest their crops once they grew to maturity.\n\n#### Hibernation\nIn the winter, they would all store their yield, and have a large feat together as a tribe. Each tree would be lit up by magical candles as everybody sat down to eat with each other, and once the feast was over at midnight they would all resign themselves to their hibernatory dens and sleep all the way through to the pre-flood season.\n\n## Sarvaran Oligarchy\nAs the city-state developed, it became clearer and clearer that such a centralised monarchical governmental system was not viable, especially as the city grew and more Morellic towns were being built nearby. So after a while, Kallaśí appointed an array of 8 oligarchs to rule over different portions of the city and surrounding areas. These oligarchs were all chosen from the most important and influential families, each being the matriarch of their respective house.\n\nEssentially, these people were given a lot of control over their own district to enforce rules, imprison, and alter the way things work in their respective areas. Their subjects would pay taxes to them, ad half of the money would be given to Kallaśí the queen.\n\nThese oligarchs would convene at the royal tree with the queen, discussing matters such as crime, taxes, citizen loyalty, war with other tribes, among other things. In addition, they were also trained by Kallaśí to be proficient sorcerers; they gained great Alucinara-Endurance and a great knowledge of how to use [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) for their own purposes as people in power.\n\nHowever, they all had their heads and all of their fur shaven. this was to show their loyalty to Sarvara, as Squirrels were worshipped and revered religiously in Morellic society, and fur was seen as a connection to their divine ancestors. It showed a great amount of loyalty to forsake one's connection to their religion in place of a show of commitment to their country, despite how embarrassing it may have seemed.\n","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":[""]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct4":{"title":"ct4","content":"next episode ideas:\n- working on charms and curses\n- magic amount and expertise scales with size and influence","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":[]},"/religion/auruk-religion":{"title":"Aurűk Religion","content":"# Deities\nThe Aurűk's primary deity was the Petrified Child; a figure they termed Stéyą.

These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with Alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to alucinarium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["species","fauna","slug"]},"/species/fauna/djidjit":{"title":"Djidjit","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["species","fauna","skipper"]},"/species/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDragons, native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), are a small amphibian species capable of flight.

They largely feed on plankton, algae, and small organisms, and inhabit the pond in which they were born until they reach adulthood.\n\n### Adult Phase","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["species","fauna"]},"/species/fauna/ikplik":{"title":"Ikplik","content":"## Overview\nThe Ikplik is a [mundozoan](species/mundozoa.md) animal native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm).

To the [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin.md) minikin, ikpliks are treated as both pets and livestock; sheared for their wool, skinned for their pelt, and used to enrich farm soil.\n\nThey are rarely eaten by all races but the [austerkin](groups/austerkin) as their diet results in the accumulation of toxins in their flesh.

They are arboreal omnivores which tend toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They are capable of language, and appear anthropoid.\n\n## Adaptation\nMany red squirrels that had found themselves in the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md) as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and are subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;\n- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,\n- greater agility and capacity for stealth,\n- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.\n\n## Morphology\nMinikin measure at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same Alucinara that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Morellic Race\n\n### Austerkin Race\nThe Austerkin are a lot hairier compared to other minikin races.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution can vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tends to have hair, and the tail is fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin are almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin are hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour can vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour can vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucinarium](phenomena/Alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tend to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's den(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or dens.\n\nModern minikin groups inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees are often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commits a crime, they are ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails are seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and disconnection from the soul is representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' can vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group is too large for one community, it inevitably collapses. A varying amount of groups form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups are often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucinarium secretion and essential shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, are greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernate in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin become unconscious in a sleep-like state, and alucinarium levels in the brain increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protect the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis is not seen in normal sleep, but is shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucinarium in the brain during hibernation is a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["species","fauna","rodent","featured"]},"/species/fauna/snails":{"title":"snails","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/botanists":{"title":"Botanists","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nBotanists grew to inhabit the 3rd realm, and they buckled the trend of *animals* taking the sentient role in an ecosystem. In fact, Botanists are plants; rather than eating, they employ Alucinaratrophy, absorbing Alucinara to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.\n\nThey did little to adapt to their surroundings, apart from the development of toxins and thorns to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat them. Rather, the bulk of their evolution came from the bombardment of Alucinara they recieved during their development, speeding up the process and applying drastic physiological changes.\n\nThe botanists took on a radial body plan, with 6 to 8 thorned roots at the bottom of their bodies. Once reaching maturity, these roots would leave the ground and serve as legs, so that the botanists cold place their seeds far away. In addition, they featured a skirt of very many leaves specialised for Alucinaratrophy and four eyes on stalks around a long tendril that laid retracted in a mouth-like pouch on a long thorned neck at the top of the body. The tendril would come out when object manipulation was needed, or when it was time to release seeds, which would also be stored in the pouch.\n\nThe botanists had a semi-sophisticated society, mirroring insects such as ants or termites, where all will serve a purpose in the colony, communicating with the use of pheromones released from the mouth-pouch. Colonies would be planted by a group of mature botanists, plunging their tendrils into the soil to lay their seeds deep in the ground, which wouch eventually grow into a patch and go on to plant more and more colonies.","lastmodified":"2024-03-12T18:30:30.52193407Z","tags":["species","fauna","fernfolk"]},"/species/flora/freakleaf":{"title":"Freakleaf","content":"## Overview\nFreakleaf is the name given to a plant native to the [1st Realm](locations/1st-realm.md).
