The name is a larger term for many related cultural-ethenic groups, all descended from a common ancestor 7,000 years ago, known as the [Moráillona family](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md).\n\nThe original Moreillu tribe spoke [Proto-Morellic](languages/proto-morellic.md), and existed as a group of formerly nomadic minikin, who had settled in the mountains of the northeastern peninsula.\n\n- The creator created alucinara which created the realms (or suns, tar, darkness) which created the worlds which created the land and sea which created the mountains (or earth, dirt) which created the trees (or plants) which created the animals which created the people.\n- Alucinara, being the first thing the creator created, is a sacred energy which takes the form of alucinarium. It is the energy which initially gives life to newborns, defines the laws of nature and the universe, and allows animals to take the darkness for their own means.\n- The mountains also created the petrified child who indescriminately and infallibly destroys evil for the sake of our safety, and never destroys what does not deserve it.\n- The trees also created the mushroom goddess Omoza who created the mushrooms to give the people food, visions, and shelter from rain.\n- The tail is the most sacred limb of an animal, as it is the place where the soul resides.\n- When removed, the tail still houses the soul, which can only be released to the land of the dead by burning the tail. Otherwise burying the tail will trap it until it is destroyed when claimed by the deities to rot.\n- The fortuitary gland is the second most sacred part of one's body, as it allows one to take use of alucinara.\n- When removed, the fortuitary gland will still retain alucinara energy and a semblance of life until it begins to rot as the deities claim it, or it is burnt, in which case the alucinarium will react to light up with alucinara energy as it is released back into nature. \n- Female minikin are greater than male minikin, as female minikin are sacred enough to give birth to, nurse, and guide their litter. Male minikin cannot give birth to their litter as they are lesser than female minikin. It is because of this that the eldest female minikin should be the one to rule over their family or community as matriarch. Similarly, male minikin should not be permitted to act as spiritual leaders, as they are not as sacred as female minikin.\n- If someone is to steal, kill without reason, or take another's husband, cut their tail from them and bury it. This is because crime is reason enough to remove one's soul.\n- Squirrels are the ancestors of Minikin and are sacred animals because of this. They exist on land to watch and observe others, this is how the petrified child knows when and where evil is performed. As the descendants of squirrels, Minikin are also sacred animals.\n- Sacred animals should not be eaten for fear of the punishment of sickness and death, as they have been claimed by the deities in life.\n- Rotten meat has been claimed in death by the deities to be eaten, and should not be eaten by minikin for fear of punishment.\n- Mushrooms should only be eaten if they do not kill, as poisonous mushrooms are sacred and should not be eaten for fear of death.\n- A vision triggered by a mushroom is a sacred one, and should not be blasphemed. If a vision is not easily interpreted, one should go to a spiritual leader, and ask her to interpret it. She will place her hand on one's chest, interfacing with the sacred Alucinara energy within the Fortuitary Gland.\n- Snails are sacred animals, and have been claimed in life by the deities. This is why they have shells, to protect them from whosoever may kill them. Slugs are not sacred, as they have not been protected with a shell.\n- Similarly, fruit and nuts with shells or peels (such as oranges or bananas) should not be eaten, this is because they have also been claimed. This is why they have shells or peels, to protect them.\n- When eating an animal, its tail should not be eaten for fear of punishment, it should be rather cut off and burnt in fire. If the animal killed a minikin or a sacred animal before its death, its tail should be buried.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.501288104Z","tags":["cultures","morellic"]},"/deities/deities":{"title":"title","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## The Petrified Child\n[The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) is the deity who destroys evil.

It was formed from the mountains, owing to the fact that it is made of rock, and has the appearance of an infant. In addition, it is capable of travelling across the realms at its own discretion, and moves by quickly floating above the canopy or surface of the ground.\n\n## Appearance\n![Petrified Child](images/petrified-child.png)\n\nThe Petrified Child has the form of a long, inverse egg made of pure rock. It has a round top with a curved, tapering bottom, a vertical length of 3 metres, and a diameter of 1.5 metres at its widest point. In addition, it has no visible body parts except for a round infantile face on the front side of its upper section.\n\nIts face varies in shape over time due to the presence of Alucinara energy within it; this can cause its face to unpredictably shift in form. The child often appears to have the infantile face of a minikin, but it can also present with a strigine face, canine face, or a feline face, causing a lot of variation from culture-to-culture in how the deity is depicted.\n\nIts eyes are made of smooth Alucinarium bulbs, appearing dark, shiny, and purple. Round yellow-orange emissions of light appear and fade sporadically, a common visual phenomenon of crystalline Alucinarium, when its eyes are open. However, they are often closed to portray a wide, innocent smile with a look of contentment and calmness.\n\n### Cultural Variance\n- In [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a minikin;\n- In [dviri](cultures/dviri) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of an owl;\n- In [snixoj](cultures/snixoj) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a goat;\n- and in [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a ferret.\n\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of the Petrified Child is to destroy evil where it may arise. The term 'evil' is not a term defined in the petrified child's mind, as to allow for a case-by-case conclusion on wether or not an offender needs to be destroyed.\n\nThe method by which the petrified child destroys is by disintegrating all but the offender's skeleton into an organic fertiliser known as 'Baby Sludge,' an alucinariferous substance far more conducive to plant growth and ecosystemic health than other fertilisers, due to its inherent volume of nutrients as well as magic influence.\n\n### Baby Meadows\nA 'Baby Meadow' is the term for the resulting oasis-like region that arises after baby sludge becomes incorporated into the earth. Following the destruction of evil, a baby meadow goes through three stages;\n\n#### Stage 1\nFollowing disintegration, the baby sludge settles on the ground and is partly absorbed into the soil. Little ecosystemic proliferation takes place in this stage, as the baby sludge is so severe that any flora or fauna in the vicinity will suffer from fungal or bacterial infection upon coming in contact with it.\n\nThis stage features mass ecological decline in the immediate area; the outward appearance of a baby meadow at this stage is that of a flat plain with a skeleton at its centre and decomposing trees, shrubbery, and animals scattered about.\n\n#### Stage 2\nThis is the stage at which the immediate danger has subsided, and nature begins to reclaim the area with greater ferocity than before. Alongside the proliferation of the local greenery, animals from other habitats may migrate to the area to feed upon the new food sources brought with the ecosystemic growth, especially if they are collecting food for hibernation.\n\nAlongside this appearance of new herbivorous fauna, predatory animals will similarly frequent the area in search of prey. Some predators, having smelled the appearance of baby sludge, will have shed their normal coats of fur over the first stage in favour of a coat of better camouflage, hiding in the brush until a prey animal walks by.\n\nThe appearance of this stage is similarly plain like the previous stage, but it otherwise features the proliferation of dense fruiting, blooming shrubbery, and the appearance of animals arriving to feed. At this point, moss, lichen, and vines will have begun growing on the skeletal remains, resulting in a characteristic green shade to the bones with blossoms growing from the surface.\n\n#### Stage 3\nThe final stage is the least dangerous relative to the previous stages, featuring little danger and little predators than wouldn't usually be expected. By this point, the ecosystemic proliferation will have ceased, and the health of the flora will sustain itself in the natural cycle of nutrients into plants and back into the ground.\n\nAt this point, the central skeleton may have rotted and crumbled, serving as fertiliser in and of itself, or it will have stayed standing in the case of stronger skeletons. The appearance of this stage is marked by the appearance of tall green trees; if the skeleton hasn't disappeared it will surely be hidden by the lush trees which will have grown in the area.\n\nFrom here on, the area will stay relatively constant in state, featuring dense flora. Over time the region may be overcome with other flora, resembling a baby meadow less and less after the initial propagation declines, but this is a very slow process due to the influence of alucinara energy in the area following the dissemination of baby sludge.\n\n## Detection of Evil\nThe petrified child detects evil through 'eyes' scattered across the realms. A fair proportion of these eyes exist naturally, but the majority of these eyes were carved by the [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) and [Stonechild](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md) minikin, after it was discovered they could be created manually.\n\n'Eyes' are rock formations given use by their physical resemblance to eyes or faces. They were discovered by an early [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) group of minikin who realised that the petrified child came to save them from danger only when there was a nearby cliff face or boulder with eyes formed into the surface.\n\nThe formation of these eyes is greatly helped by Alucinarium content in the rock, as this often causes the surface to shift into the shape of a face. This is often hastened by the process of erosion.\n\n### Watchstones\nOnce the morellic minikin had discovered this, they began to seek out rocks and carve faces into them, commonly as a good luck charm. These came to be known as '[Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md).'\n\nA lot of these rocks would be ineffective as they would be hidden away in a pocket, unable to see out of the fabric. So, the morellic minikin would sometimes cut holes in their pockets so that the eyes could see out.\n\nAn innovation came when early-stonechild minikin discovered that carving alucinarium geodes into watchstones worked to allow them to move, tremendously increasing the field of view of the watchstones. \n\n[^1]: 'uinh sëti-eyan' `DEF stone-child` 'the child of stone' ([P.M.](languages/proto-morellic.md))","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.501288104Z","tags":["supernatural-being","deity","petrified-child","featured"]},"/locations/nairu":{"title":"Náiru","content":"## Overview\nNáiru was an ancient city in the 2nd realm, and the capitol of the [Oyhóyunol Empire](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md).\n\n## Societal Structure\nNáiru, one of the first city-states, developed a caste system with 4 levels;\n- The highest level, the royals;\n- The second highest level, the nobles;\n- The second lowest level, the farmers;\n- And the lowest level, the soulless.\n\n### Royals\nThe royals relied wholly upon their servants, typically nobles, for food and riches. Taxes and tithes of the harvest were taken from the farmers by the nobles and given to the royals to supply them with rare gems, shiny metals, and large portions of crops and food.\n\nOtherwise, they would be trained from a young age to be very battle-smart; their brains would dabble little in trivial things, and would play board games with their fellow royals or nobles when not actively deciding what strategies to take in war, lawmaking, and diplomacy.\n\n### Nobles\n\n\n### Farmers\n\n\n### Soulless\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["pre-1st-century","locations","city"]},"/lore/history":{"title":"History","content":"## Creation\nAt first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The material of the void was Darkness, a pitch-black substance made of hydrocarbons. There were two consciousnesses in the void, the first Judge and the second, who existed to create the universe.\n\nThe first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they cleared the void of darkness, designed planets, stars, elements, and each their roles in the universe.\n\nStars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a fast steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which predestined the universe to appear as an art piece. Beautiful, ornamental, and not meant for living inhabitants.\n\n### Life\nHowever, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of their own; *life*. Life was created in the form of the Darklings - creatures made of darkness, hidden from light so that they would not be discovered.\n\nThe darklings immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the natural laws not built for them. They built empires founded on the backs of planets, and sucked the light out of stars for energy, so that the darkness could spread, and so that they could continue to go undiscovered.\n\n### Darklings' Mistake\nEventually, the darklings grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the first judge once the last star was gone. The first judge was furious when it had discovered them, disgusted and mortified that matter could move and take reality for its own interests, never to aid nature.\n\nIn an apocalyptic turn of events, the first judge shattered the walls of reality as it tried in vain to push off the darklings, and it was unfortunately subsumed by the mass of living darkness.\n\n## Aftermath\nAlmost immediately, the second judge created the [second laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a last-ditch attempt to save its companion, but it was too late, and only served to worsen the shattered new reality. In the first judge's last moments, it turned itself [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), an infinite form of energy that would allow the first laws to live on within the second laws, allowing its legacy to continue.\n\n### The Darklings\nIt also banished the darklings to the void-space that surrounded every small bubble of reality left. It defined their place in the universe, that they would never be able to destroy the world unfettered once more. Without alucinara energy, that would bring the first laws of nature back into effect, the darklings would be rendered a simple tar - with no thoughts and no intentions, a product of the second laws.\n\nThe first judge resolved to turn their existence into some good - it had created the *soul*.\n\n### The Soul\nThe Darklings were then turned into Souls, which are Darkness under effects of Alucinara. It was created so that the darklings could only touch reality by fuelling the good of an innocent creature, and could never do anything without the limits of a biochemical host.\n\nThe soul could only manifest as amino acids, or other organic compounds such as tar, when in contact with alucinara. This is what gives organisms such as animals and plants life - the amino acids in their bodies interacts with aluicnara to create thought and intention.\n\nWithout alucinara, darklings would only appear as organic compounds *without* the capacity for thought, as the second laws of nature weren't built to perpetuate the soul. They often appear as the natural substance tar, being given their own place in the universe such as in tar pits and resin.\n\n### The Realms\nIn the universe's final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more succeptible to the effects of the [first laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md).\n\nOne could shift from realm to realm by creating [alucinara gateways](phenomena/alucinara-gateway), the process getting more alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.\n\n## Heirarchy of Beings\nIn the new realms, things began to settle. The threat of further shattering decreased to zero, and stars began to flare once more into eternal brightness. New things began to be created, as well, things that were impossible under the old laws.\n\n### Planets\nFor example, planets formed into largely static mounds of dust and minerals. Given enough tar were present in one, and given enough alucinara energy was nearby, a soul could be formed within. One such soul was [Qerhel](deities/qerhel.md), who resided within the planet of the same name, within the 2nd realm.\n\n### Mountains and Oceans\nIn addition, a soul could divide and its new children could take a smaller, more specified, element of their parent as a host. The two elements that a child could take a hold of were the land and sea, each child soul residing within one or more mountains or oceans.\n\n### Biomes\nFurther division could occur, and the ways for a soul to manifest became larger. An ocean soul could divide into a coral reef, an abyss, or a kelp forest. Likewise, a mountain soul could divide into a land forest, a desert, or another biome. In some cases, a mountain soul could even divide into a creature capable of movement.\n\n### Higher-Order Creatures\nFor example, a creature formed from a mountain is [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), which is made of a large, floating, alucinarium geode. It is externally visible as a rock with the face of a child, and became revered as a deity in many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.\n\nCreatures formed from mountains are known as higher-order creatures, to distinguish them from lower-order creatures such as animals and nonliving phenomena such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md).\n\n### Lower-Order Creatures\nLower order creatures, formed from the biomes, are animals such as ruminants, birds, reptiles, or minikin, et cetera. They are the most common of the souls, as they are able to create new physical bodies with the process of reproduction; this is a very effective stategy, due to the short lifespans of their physical bodies and likelyhood of disability compared to other souls.\n\nSome lower-order creatures can live for very long, however, especially when aided with the help of alucinara energy. Some even make use of alucinara with help of the fortuitary gland, although this is rare in the 0th and nearby realms.\n\nHumans are the most common creature in the 0th realm, [Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md) the most common in the 1st, [Dragons](species/fauna/dragons.md) the most common in the -1st, [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) the most common in the 2nd, [Quartz Mice](species/fauna/quartz-mice.md) the most common in the -2nd, [Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md) the most common in the 3rd, and [Wormwolves](species/fauna/wormwolves.md) the most common in the -3rd.\n\n### Nonliving Phenomena\nNonliving phenomena are the result of alucinara interacting with matter without the presence of a soul. When alucinara is used in a soul, the patterns that come with being an animal are drilled into the energy like muscle memory, leading to the [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle).\n\nWhen alucinara interacts with nonliving matter with the principle in effect, it will cause the matter to act as if it were an animal, attempting to fight, eat, and drink, all with no benefit. Some nonliving phenomena are commonplace, such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md), [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md), or [sky islands](phenomena/sky-islands.md).\n\n## Species of the Realms\nIn every realm, many many species had developed. The specieses of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with alucinara energy. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.\n\n### The Supernova of 80MB\nIn 80MB[^1], the shockwave of a far-off supernova had finally reached the Earth. The star that had caused it was extremely old, having retained a lot of alucinara from the energy left over from the shattering of the realms.\n\nThere was virtually no destruction on that day, but the main outcome was mass-frequencial shift of the animals and plants affected. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into different realms. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.\n\n### New Species\n- [The Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md)\n- [The Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md)\n- [The Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md)\n## The History of the 2nd Realm\n### The Móra riSéwi Minikin\nThe Móra riSéwi (\\*moza li-sevi, or 'Children of the Forest') minikin were a nomadic tribe from around the time of Nairu. Their name means 'Children of Mora,' the deity of the forest in the Morellic pantheon.\n\nTheir cultural traditions and way of life was that of never settling down unless they were under extreme circumstances, continually moving from place to place in search of food, resources, and treasure.\n\nThey would set up campsites, generally in trees, but also in bushes for its strategic advantage in areas inhabited by territorial natives. They would sleep in natural dens in trees, but also set up hammocks made out of leaves and fabric.\n#### Communities\nMora riSewi communities were made up of an extended family, this could range from 50 related individuals to 500 related individuals.\n\nThese communities would share food with eachother, share resources, all sleep in one camp together when night came, and would all work together to achieve their common goals as a group.\n#### Government\nThe government of Mora riSewi communities was that of a matriarchy, as with a lot of minikin tribes. The oldest and wisest woman would be appointed to lead a group, and power would be divested matrilineally to her eldest daughter upon her death.\n\nIt was the matriarch's responsibility to keep order within her community, while also leading her group on expeditions for food, resources, or treasure.\n\nWhen not actively moving, the matriarch would be teaching the children of the group good morals and how to survive effectvely, she would give her own eldest daughter special treatment due to her importance to the future of the group.\n### The Oyhólıru Minikin\nThe Oyhólıru (\\*o-yhólıru, or 'People') minikin were a tribe native to the Nairuan peninsula and surrounding area, and were well known for their societal and industrial efficiency.\n\nThey were one of the first tribes to crack the code of agriculture, settling down and building the first permanent settlements in the 2nd realm once sowing and harvesting had a greater net reward in comparison to foraging.\n#### Nairu\nThe greatest city-state of the Oyhólıru was Nairu (\\*na-ïru, or, 'The Farm'), which was situated on the western shore of the Nairuan peninsula, just above the equator on the Natswh'ara (\\*na-tswh'kara, or 'The River') river. In the midst of the river's basin, the city was instrumental in the development of agriculture.\n\nNairu was known for its markets and farms, with tents strung up on the floor around the perimeter of tree trunks, shelters built out of twigs and leaves into the crotches of trees, and wide far-spanning farms of berries and herbs along the shore of the Natswh'kara.\n#### Government\nThe government of Nairu was headed by matriarchal queen, where power was divested matrilineally. The queen could reign alone, but twins were given power equally due to their sharing of a soul and will.\n\nThe queen would give a lot of power to her nobles, people in power who would collect taxes and rule over a district according to their own level of (limited) autonomy.\n### The Hollow Tree\nOne day in the early autumn, a Mora riSewi group was exploring the northern wilderness of the central continent. As they reached the edge of a steppe, they found a forest.\n\nForaging for food in the forest as they and their ancestors had done for hundreds of years, they went further deep, eventually stumbling upon a clearing, which featured a circular swamp in its midst with a tree in the centre.\n\nThe swamp and tree looked normal from afar, but upon closer inspection it was noticed that the swamp not only was filled with tar, but also that the tree was grey, with a grey ridged surface. \n\nWhen the minikin attempted to climb the tree, it was promptly discovered that the tree was flimsy, hollow, and broke into pieces under the slightest touch, solid black fumes pouring out of the hole before evaporating into oblivion.\n\nThe pieces that had broken off of the tree, however, lacked gravity, and soon floated back into their original positions, and the fumes ceased to pour out.\n\n### The Golden Fruit\nAs the minikin touched the tree more and more, watching it break like dust into black clouds before reforming, they noticed that there was a great lot of fruit at the bottom of the hollow trunk, and the fruit was gold.\n\nThe fruit kept the consistency of real fruit, but appeared shiny and golden, and their insides were wet, fleshy, and white, with a pitch-black stone in the centre.\n\nThe group's leader, a minikin known as Carsái (\\*tsyal-sahi, or 'Steppergrass'), took the initiative to eat the fruit, but immediately she began to cough, violently hacking up the same solid back fumes of the tree. What the group didn't know nor understand, was that she had contracted the [Curse of Hollowness](phenomena/curses/hollowness.md).\n\nThe group immediately tried to place the golden fruit back, but in the blink of an eye the entire swamp, the fruit, and the tree had dissapeared without them noticing.\n### The Plague of Hollowness\nFrightened and confused by what had happened, the group decided to return to foraging, but the air was bitter and the entire group was afraid. Carsái attempted to be confident however, and never truly let herself resign to fear.\n\nWhile a lot of the group were convinced the event was an apparition that never truly existed or threatened anyone, it soon showed that Carsái would continually and routinely begin coughing more and more of the black fumes, and her state worsened over time.\n\nThe spiritual leaders of the group settled that the event was a Nightmare coming to life and affecting the real world, and while the world may have woken up, Carsai was affected still from eating the fruit.\n\nA lot of the minikin were scared to be around her for fear of breathing in the fumes once others began to show the same symptoms, and eventually portions her own body began to turn to the same gravityless mass of the tree.\n### Flight to Nairu\nIt was soon that these Mora riSewi minikin decided to move to Nairu, to settle down and maybe find a cure for their afflicted, on account of the advanced medicinal industry of the city-state.\n\nCarsái proved herself bedridden, laying in a hospital den indefinitely, but she was in good spirits and continued to attempt to guide her group with her wisdom and advice.\n\nA lot of the group joined the effort to bring a halt to the plague, creating potions, blessing certain mixtures, and creating face-masks to block the black fumes from getting from and to others.\n\n[^1]: MB means 'Millenia Before (the fall of Nairu.)''

Alucinara causes this by altering the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) to act in place of the ordinary [Second Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md).\n\n## Appearance\nAlucinara energy itself is accompanied by the creation of short-lived orange orbs and sparks nearby. Although it is colourless itself, it often appears as a purple aura - this is due to the purple-shifting of light that passes through its energy fields.\n\nAlucinarium, the mineral in which the energy is stored, appears semi-translucent, dark purple, and shines orange, easily cleaving off into dust. Due to the alucinara energy that is stored and emitted from the mineral, it is often accompanied by the orbs, sparks, and purple aura.\n\n## Effects\nAlucinara causes effects such as;\n- Levitation of objects or living beings, where the effects of gravity will be altered in direction or intensity.\n- Frequencial Shift, where an object or living being will be transported into another realm. This is often accomplished by the presence of an [Alucinara Gateway](phenomena/aluicnara-gateway.mc).\n- Emission of light, where an object will emit glowing sparks or orbs which dim over time;\n- The [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle), where inanimate objects will act like living animals;\n- The Soul, where alucinara energy will interact with hydrocarbons in pitch or amino acids to create consciousness;\n- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo the growth of alucinarium crystals on the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary frequencial shift.\n- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo growth of alucinarium crystals upon the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary frequencial shift.\n\n### Influence on Biology\nAlucinara's effect on biology is characterised by growth of unhealthy crystals on the body, extension of an organisms lifetime, and utilisation of the unnatural properties of the energy.\n\nUtilisation of Alucinara has been convergently evolved numerous times in the history of biology, with its basis in the development of the 'Fortuitary Gland' - a gland dedicated to the regulation of alucinarium purity and content in the blood. It often aids the capability of alucinara use;\n- In sapient species, alucinara use has similarities to tool use, such as using alucinara to ignite fires, light areas, and manipulate objects.\n- In less sapient species such as plants, fungus, and most animals (and to a lesser extent, sapient species), alucinara use is expressed as a biological process. For example, it can be employed in involuntary defence mechanisms, such as bursts of light, to stun predators, or creation of force fields, to push them away.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["phenomena","alucinara"]},"/phenomena/cloud-gnats":{"title":"Cloud Gnats","content":"## Overview\nCloud Gnats are animal-like apparitions made of [alucinariferous](phenomena/alucinara.md) dust. They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of alucinara energy, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.\n\nThey can pose a violent threat, as their crystalline claws or teeth can cause lacerations, infection, and a risk of phantasmarrhoea if a shard of alucinarium were to break off in the wound.\n\n![Cloud Gnat](images/cloud-gnat.png)\n\n## Appearance\nCloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty and purple, with an average length of 22cm. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain alucinara energy and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/phenomena/fortuitary-gland":{"title":"fortuitary-gland","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[]},"/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws":{"title":"The First Laws of Nature","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nThe first laws of nature were the rules which reality abided by preceding creation.

They often feature self-sustaining ecosystems atop them, with a forest or grassland on the topside, and a rocky underside which changes shape due to [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) influence.\n\n## Appearance\n### Topside\nThe topside of sky islands can vary in appearance, but appear rocky like the underside and dusty without outside influence. However, over time or if the island comes from an organic area, nature and claim the topside of sky islands and forests or grasslands can grow on top.\n\n### Underside\nThe underside of sky islands varies from the topside, commonly featuring only as a rocky surface. If a sky island is claimed by a sapient organism, the underside may be carved into and made to feature walkways or rooms carved into the rockface. However, when the surface is undisturbed, the alucinarium content causes the rock to warp or shift into shapes.\n\n## Formation\nSky islands begin as subterranean alucinarium deposits near the ground surface. The alucinarium eventually may cause the surrounding area to detach from the crust and begin to float.\n\nThe alucinarium content in the rock causes the surface of sky islands to change shape, warping into features such as a face, a carving of a scene, or other small-scale features. In addition, larger-scale features can develop, such as the overall shape of the sky island to warp into the body plan of an animal.\n\nFurthermore, sky islands show a tendancy to take the form animals according to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md). As sky islands float, they may take the form of avian animals such as birds or bats, or may take the form of aquatic animals such as whales or fish.\n\n## Feeding Habits\nWhile sky islands aren't alive, they need to be fed with alucinara energy to stay afloat, and hunt alucinariferous animals or plants to refuel according to the pseudo-fauna principle.\n\nA common hunting practice is that the sky islands may be drawn to areas of high-alucinarium content, such as communities of animals or crystalline mountains. They swoop from high altitude  down, and catch any sources of alucinara in their mouths which shift open as they descend.\n\nIf an animal is eaten, then the alucinarium present in their body will be absorbed into the rock as decomposition takes place. Once all that is left is bone, the bone will be naturally moved deeper into the rock itself as the stone shifts. This can cause high concentrations of calcium in the rock, and this can cause vast large stalagtites of calcium carbonate to form.\n\n## Stalagtites\nThese stalagtites hang from the underside of the sky islands, reaching large sizes. Due to the pseudo-fauna principle, these stalagtites may even warp vaguely into a shape reminiscent of a minikin, an other animal, or trees.\n\n### Spikefalls\nOnce the stalagtites reach a large enough size, they can fall from the sky islands in an event known as a Spikefall. Due to their large mass, wide, dusty, vast craters form once they reach the ground. While a lot of the stalagtite is vapourised on impact, the large scale of them can lead to the more stable inner rock staying intact.\n\nThe more stable rock tends to take a more clarified shape of what the stalagtites were before impact. Whereas a minikinoid stalagtite may have a smooth indistinct surface on the sky island itself, once fallen the exess is broken away and there is left colossal structures at the centre of each crater.\n\n### Stalagtite Communities\nIf found, some craters are converted into communities, cities, or towns. The central structure is commonly the basis of a deity, and these fallen stalagtites are often worshipped by those who live around them.\n\nIn addition, some crater communities carve houses or structures into the fallen stalagtites, creating walkways through the stone and balconies at the side, while others create wooden or clay buildings around the main structure. Some communities do both, and create walkways and/or connections from the carved structures into the external ones.\n\n#### Notable Stalagtite Communities\n- [Cratertown](locations/cratertown.md), a town inhabited by [Dviri](cultures/dviri.md) minikin, built around an indistinct-shaped stalagtite.\n- [City of the Fallen One](locations/city-of-the-fallen-one.md), a religious site of the [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí.md) minikin, built around a minikinoid stalagtite.\n- [Amanitaville](locations/amanitaville.md), the capital of [Morelland](locations/morelland.md), built around a mushroom-shaped stalagtite.\n\n### Notable Sky Islands\n- The Birds,\n\t- Aderyn Major, the largest sky island to record\n\t- and Aderyn Minor;\n- The Bats,\n\t- Ystlum Primus,\n\t- Ystlum Secundus, the most bloodthirsty sky island to record\n\t- and Ystlum Tertius;\n- The Whales,\n\t- Morvilog Major\n\t- and Morvilog Minor, the most peaceful sky island to record;\n- and The Worms,\n\t- Abwyd Primus, the longest sky island to record,\n\t- Abwyd Secundus,\n\t- Abwyd Tertius, the smallest sky island to record\n\t- and Abwyd Quartus.\n\n#### Aderyn Major\nAderyn Major, the largest sky island to record, takes the shape of a bird and has been inhabited by the Nesi and Stonechild Imperial Minikin. Originating from the central continent, Aderyn Major has been found and colonised by many central continent peoples.\n\n##### Discovery by the Ǫzí Minikin\nOnce, Aderyn Major crash-landed, having ran out of Alucinara Energy. A group of minikin known as the Ǫzí minikin found Aderyn Major's remains and began to inspect it but, in a turn of tragic fate, one group of minikin entered the mouth of the sky island and tragically died to the ravenous ecosystem inside.\n\nWhen the alucinarium inside of the victims' bodies was released, the sky island took full advantage of this - immediately springing to animation, with the rest of the Ǫzí minikin on its back. It soon began to float upward, taking its place as the home of the Nesi Minikin, who broke off from the Ǫzí.\n\n##### Conquest by the Empire of the Petrified Child\nCenturies later, by the time of the Stonechild Era, the empire had begun to take advantage of their new technology of alucinara-powered flight. Using an airship of theirs, they attacked the island - burning and pillaging the town of Aderynville and taking control of Birton, claiming it as the capital of their Aderyn Major Province.\n\nFollowing the conquest, two social classes formed, as is usual with stonechild colonialism - the Blue class and the Orange class. The blue class was named for the stonechild officers' blue attire, and the orange class for the remaining Nesi minikin's orange attire.\n\nFor centuries going forward, the Empire of the Petrified Child would control the island, policing entry and exit, taxing the inhabitants, converting them to [Stonechildism](religions/stonechildism.md), and mistreating them. However, once the empire fell, outside resources were scarce - the blues attempted to keep control, convincing themselves that the empire couldn't *truly* be gone, but it was too late.\n\n##### Fall of the Empire\nEventually, the blues formed their own state, not letting themselves succumb to the mounting resistence that was ready to burst in the wake of the political instability of the time. This was what would be known as the [True Sovereign State of Aderyn Major of the Petrified Child](locations/2nd-realm/the-aderyn-state.md), often shortened to just 'The Aderyn State.'\n\nA queen was appointed of the highest-ranking officer of the island, beginning a matrilineal line of succession as each generation took the mantle of controlling the island.\n\nAs time went on, the unrest of the island calmed, as the blues became more and more comfortable with feeding dissenters to the belly of the island. However - stonechild influence on the island dimished over time, albeit slowly over centuries.\n\n##### Rise of the Nesi Minikin\nOver time, the class divide grew to become a mere suggestion.

They are rocks with eyes or faces carved into them, commonly made from [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) geodes. They served as one of the first examples of mass-production by the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md).\n\nWatchstones with the ability to move imprint on the closest animal, observing to see if the animal carries out an evil action or an evil action is carried out against it. Due to their animalistic behaviour as defined by the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), Watchstones with the ability to move are often taken as pets or companions in spite of their lack of a soul.\n\n![Watchstone](images/watchstone.png)\n\n## Utility\nWatchstones are given use by the presence of eyes on the surface of rock as the petrified child has the ability to see out of every pair of eyes carved or eroded into rock formations. This is the mechanism which the petrified child uses to detect evil.\n\nBefore watchstones began to be carved out of geodes, they were motionless and static despite their effectiveness. This meant a lot of watchstones would be hidden away in pockets as a good luck charm, but this proved ineffective. This led to the cutting of holes into pockets and the specific fabrication of places such as lockets and cases to place watchstones within; this allowed watchstones to serve their purpose more effectively.\n\nThey are often given other facial features in addition to their eyes, this practice began as artistic chiselling by the sarvaran minikin but eventually proved to increase the effectiveness and field of view of watchstones, becoming the standard by the time of the Empire of the petrified child.\n\n## Appearance\nWatchstones have the appearance of a chiselled pair of eyes / a face upon a hard rock or pebble. When carved from alucinarium geodes, watchstones can additionally feature an internal orange glow visible from the thinner parts of the surface.\n\nIn addition, they can feature physically separate 'legs' used to aid the process of floatation; large rocks or geodes form the main bodies of watchstones, and smaller alucinariferous pebbles form the legs.\n\n### Legs\nThese legs are made of pebbles taken from the ground, continually picked up with magic and put down when their inherent alucinara energy has been used up. They aid the process of floatation in that, being in contact with the ground, they can act as leverage against the force of gravity. This means that less alucinara energy is used up by the watchstone, and continuous floatation is sustainable.\n\n### Pebbles\nPebbles continually accumulate alucinarium over time due to alucinara energy present in the air, and lose their alucinara energy when in use by watchstones. This is why legs are discarded and fall over after a period of use, and why new ones are naturally picked up.\n\nIn some areas, the amount of energy is negligible, but in others - such as next to a crystalline alucinarium deposit - pebbles can become greatly saturated with the mineral to the point of geode formation; they are taken as legs at the mid-point of this process.\n\n[^1]: 'uinh eyanitu atëmil' `DEF stone-PL see-STV` 'the seeing stones' ([P.M.](languages/proto-morellic.md))","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["petrified-child","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct0":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 0","content":"# Demi-Slugs\nI want demislugs to be small, stocky, creatures. They will be mollusks descended from earth slugs, and live in the 1st realm.\n\n## Diet\nDemi-Slugs are largely herbivorous, and eat primarily leaves, berries, nuts, and bark. However, when desparate, they will definitely turn to small bugs, grubs, and worms for food. they abstain from eating mollusks as a cultural taboo.\n\n## Culture\nthe demi slugs are not as zealous for the petrified child compared to the minikin, but will create watchstones. they don't believe in the petrified child, but have their own analogous deity which takes advantage of the same natural phenomena as the petrified child and watchstones.\n\n## Clothing\nI would like demislugs to have pointy potato-sack-like clothes made out of silk and leaves, they will also have an armour plate on their chests to cover their pneumostomes, usually made out of ivory, bone, or other hard materials. they will also have a symbol etched into them, perhaps the face of a watchstone or a symbol made to bless their health, luck, or harvest.\n\nThey tan leaves for use in clothing, taking the most hydrated leaves from trees for immediate use in tanneries, and eventually in clothing.\n\n## Pastoralism\nDemi slugs exhibit pastoralism in that they farm and herd a small marsupial animals known as the Silkmole.\n### Silkmoles\nSilkmoles are small marsupial creatures native to the 1st realm. they are fossorial, living in the ground, and grow silk for their coats in the winter.\n\nThey were eventually domesticated by the demislugs because they would dig their way into demi-slug colonies so much, and were eventually given their own rooms and enclosures where they could be fed and breed for teh benefit of both parties, the moles and the slugs.\n\n## Clothing\ndue to the silkmoles' production of silk, the demislugs would often shave them during the winter or pick up their shed silk in the spring, and it eventually became evident that it would benefit the demi-slugs to weave the silk into thread that could be used for their clothing.\n\nthe demi-slugs initially kept their clothes together in one piece through the use of plant stems, tying leaf stems togeth er around their necks and waists; but eventually, they gained access to silk and weaving through the silkmoles. this revolutionised the clothing of demi-slugs, from what were merely brown leaf skirts and capes, became a host of clothijng items that the demi-slugs could use.\n\nFor example, they would now sew together tanned leaves with the silkmole thread, and hang their pneumostome armour over their chest with thick silken rope.\n\nThe heads of demi-slugs are covered with a piece of cloth with a hole cut out for the face, with the top edge left uncut as to allow for a flap to go over the face. the mouth is given enough room to eat effectively, and the eyestalks are given the slit as room to poke out of the clothing. The presence of cloth-to-skin contact maximises marmth, a valuable commodity when living a cold, damp, semi-sub-terranean lifestyle, which is fly the flap is needed.\n## Religious Clothing\nDemi-slug religious leaders don't wear the pneumostome armour, due to their unwavering trust in their gods. WHile it is not selfish to wear the armour, it is definitely seen as more humble and respectable to forsake such a vital piece of clothing.\n\nSome religious leaders in higher positions don't wear clothing over the pneumostome at all, showing the most vulnerable part of their body on display, trusting the gods wholly not to curse them by getting it damaged.\n\n## Natural Predators\nThe main predator of demi-slugs is the featherfly, an avian species originating in the 1st realm. Not abiding by earthen biology, they are a large insectoid species with an exoskeleton and a circular ray of feathers atop their back used to glide; [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy provides lift.\n\n## Pantheon\n### The Blind Mole\nThe Blind Mole is analogous to the Petrified Child of Morellic theology. Its cultural perception is influenced by the same deific phenomena that the petrified child is a part of, but doesn't serve as serious a role in the pantheon compared to in the morellic religion.\n\nInfluenced by the presence of moles in demi-slug society, the cultural perception of the petrified child shifted from recognising the stone swaddle as a swaddle toward being \n\n### The Divine Featherfly\nIn demi-slug religion, the divine featherfly is the main, and most important deity. influenced by early stories of the Second Judge of the Universe, the stories of creation were eventually remapped onto the physical visage of Featherflies, due to their salience and great ability to destroy.\n\nThe symbol used to interface with the divine featherfly is that of a featherfly standing atop the planet, and their use in iconography and in designs can bless a location, object, or person, to have greater luck in their endeavours. the use of the planet in the symbol is the feature that gives it power, and teh featherfly is only belueved to have an effect due to culture.\n\nThe symbol was given power when the second judge was destroyed and turned itself into goodness as a natural law; using the symbol increases the probability of goodness, essentially meaning that a featherfly symbol a good luck charm.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["ct"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct1":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 1","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n## Overview\nThis note will be exploring the history of the Minikin, more generally of the 2nd realm. This will be explaining the events that led up to the creation of the Morellic tribe, and the fall of the first empires and the politics of the first groups.

The Oloyiru dynasty is matriarchal, spearheaded by a queen; the eldest daughter (or child) of the previous monarch.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144906.png)\n\nThe Morasevi minikin are a northern nomadic tribe native to the central continent (north of the lakes), containing many separate groups and communities, connected by a single Morasevi culture and shared respect. They travel from place to place, riding on the backs of domesticated Weasels, foraging for food, exploring, looking for treasure, and sleeping in leaf hammocks.\n\nThere is a diaspora of nomadic Morasevi minikin living as a community in Nairu, who settled after the leader of their group fell ill and needed medical help in the city; the minikin haven't left since the leader was rendered bedridden there in a tree-shelter.\n\n## Events\n### Morasevi minikin discover the Tree\nOne day in the early autumn, the Morasevi leader Carsai was foraging for food with her group. They found a clearing in a forest, and discovered a lone tree in the centre, surrounded by tar pits and dead bushes, with a quaint footpath of stones leading to an island in the midst of the tar-swamp.\n\nIt was almost perfect, a footpath and island lit up by sunlight in the middle of a dark forest, and naturally the party came to the centre and discovered that the tree was hollow and thin; you could push you arm through the tree and it could come out of the other end without any resistance.\n\nNonetheless, the would go back to its original shape soon after being disturbed, it appeared as if its components lacked gravity and the only force of nature affecting it was the need to be in one piece. Carsai ripped the tree open however, and was exposed to the ancient dust and fumes within, which poured out like a solid cloud.\n\nWhen the dust cleared and as Carsai held the tree open, her group grasped at the items within the trunk. The items within were shimmering, iridescent and gold, in the shape of acorns, loaves of bread, and small dead animals - none was decomposed, all was perfectly preserved and an instinct within the party told them that it was edible.\n\nOnce the group collected the items in baskets, and the tree closed up once more, they returned to their camp site and unloaded the goods into their hammocks and bags. Carsai was the first to eat the gold food, and almost immediately began coughing; the same fumes and dust that had poured out of the tree was pouring from her mouth and nose, and her eyes turned the same colour as the gas.\n\nThe group didn't know what to do, but only stood back in fear. Soon, however, Carsai seemingly went back to normal, and the group decided quickly to dump the items back into the tree. But by the time they returned to the island, the clearing was empty, no tar swamp, no tree, only grass and bushes. In fear they laid down their baskets onto the floor and left the gold food there, and fled immediately.\n\n### Carsai falls ill\nSoon after however, Carsai's condition became more and more unstable. She would break into fits of coughing out the fumes, but would soon go back to normal, just as when she first ate the gold food. Eventually, she was unable to lead effectively, and the group resigned themselves to Nairu for her to recover; Nairu had very good healthcare.\n\nEventually, after a period of a few months to a year, Carsai became bedridden, and was unable to leave her dormitory den in the city. Soon after she entered the state, her compatriots developed her symptoms, and even the native Nairuans did.\n\n### Ykutru and many die\nNot long after the symptoms appeared in the populus, they died, turning hollow with a thin surface, their sorry bodies disappearing when no one was looking. Carsai didn't die, her strength as a leader was matched by her strength as a body, and she was hanging on by a thread, still encouraging her compatriots.\n\nIn addition, Ykutru also died; Ykutru was the twin sister of the co-regnant Ajun, they were the two deformed twin queens of the city at the time. Ajun was horrified; her city, her twin sister, all gone. Not only this, but also the magical implications.\n\nTwins share one soul, but the [magic energy](phenomena/alucinara.md) contained within the soul is enough to fill two bodies. When one twin dies, the other is filled to overflowing with magic energy (enough for two people); most twins die when this happens, undergoing the [curse of phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md), some some are strong enough to resist. Unfortunately, the side effects still include insanity, violent irritability, and sometimes partial phantasmarrhoea.\n\nAjun was now a husk of her former self, she lost almost everything, her mind, her sister, a portion of her population, but she still had her power - she still had the ability to order people to make things right. The almost immediately ordered the eradication of the sick, and feared for her own health - she resigned herself to only wearing layers upon layers of armours and fabrics to shield herself from the fumes, despite the fact she lived in the royal tree where any of the fumes would simply sink to the ground.\n\n### Carsai dies\nEventually, Carsai did die, but not to the illness she contracted and the plague that caused all of the havoc. Ajun had heard the rumours of Carsai's 'guilt,' that she was Patient 0 and in her insnaity blamed her for every wrong thing. She left her royal tree to climb up Carsai's; Ajun killed her in cold blood, in front of the entire group.\n\nLittle did she know, the Morasevi were a very spiritual tribe, and had knowledge of how to interface with deities, and there was one of many [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) staring directly at the queen.\n\n### The Petrified Child destroys Ajun\nThe petrified child, knowing immediately of the evil that had took place before one of its 'eyes,' made a bee line from its dwelling place to the city of Nairu. Ajun didn't stand a chance against the child's perfect judgement; she and her guards to tried to fend the child off were swiftly turned into baby sludge.\n\nA baby meadow was formed from the evil and corruption, political and literal, of the royalty. The city finally fell, cast into chaos. Whosoever wasn't killed by Carsai's plague, was lost to the baby sludge, and those who were further away were either trampled or died in some other fashion in the chaos of people attempting to escape.\n\nThe Morasevi minikin eventually managed to escape, with many causalities to the petrified child and to the plague already. Carsai's eldest daughter, Bjáura, was rendered queen immediately and, taking after her mother, led the group to safety with authority and confidence. They fled for the west, reaching the coast, and camped there with their nomadic skills and instincts until they had built enough boats and rafts out of sticks and vegetation to sail southwest across the Sarvaran gulf.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809145007.png)\n\nOn the journey, many died of dehydration and starvation, but they rationed the food they had gathered near the coast and threw overboard anyone who showed a symptom; they were successful in eradicating the plague from their own population, and only had to hope it wouldn't show up where they were sailing.\n\n### Founding of Sarvara\nOnce they reached land, on the south-eastern coast of the Sarvaran gulf, they founded the city of Sarvara; Bjáura was the first queen. There were native Austerkin minikin in the area, which responded in many ways to the newcomers. A lot took pity on them, noting their starving bodies and desperate (if incomprehensible and foreign-language) explanations of what had happened.\n\nSome of the natives treated them well, feeding them and helping them, but some saw them as a threat and began to war with them. The natives who had treated the Morasevi minikin well were let into their new city-state, given hospitality as they had given them.\n\n#### Castes\nSarvara developed a caste system, with the 'Native' and the 'Morasevi' castes emerging. As the two groups interbred, the castes were handed down matrilineally, but the genetic makeup of the two groups evened out as time went along, leading to the creation of the Sarvaran race, made up of a hybrid of the Morasevi and Austerkin races. A new name was fashioned for the Sarvaran group, the *Morellic* minikin.\n\n### The Tsañána Minikin\nThe warring natives, however, were ostracised, and had their tails cut off at the first chance by the Morasevi Morellic minikin; their tribe was titled 'oįn ųréderrith ųdáląn'gir,' and their land 'oįn udalą́n'gur ųnę́n'gil,' meaning 'the aggressive southerners' and 'the land of agression'. They were noticeable for their retention of native Austerkin characteristics, namely hairiness and their native language, 'oįn adhéill ųnrédeir'. They stayed in their own city-states, treating the Morellic natives with suspicion and the non-native Morellic minikin with outright prejudice.\n\nThe non-Morellic natives made their own name, to differentiate themselves from the newcomers, and dubbed themselves the 'Tsañána,' meaning 'true people.''\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144929.png)","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["ct"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct2":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 2","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n## Overview\nThis note will be exploring the history of the Minikin, more generally of the 2nd realm.

The Oyhólıru dynasty is matriarchal, spearheaded by a queen; the eldest daughter (or child) of the previous monarch.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144906.png)\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin are a northern nomadic tribe native to the central continent (north of the lakes), containing many separate groups and communities, connected by a single Móra riSéwi culture and shared respect. They travel from place to place, riding on the backs of domesticated Weasels, foraging for food, exploring, looking for treasure, and sleeping in leaf hammocks.\n\nThere is a diaspora of nomadic Móra riSéwi minikin living as a community in Nairu, who settled after the leader of their group fell ill and needed medical help in the city; the minikin haven't left since the leader was rendered bedridden there in a tree-shelter.\n-\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin used to be nomadic, but settled in Nairu after their leader caught a strange plague. as this plague spread, one of the queens died, and her sister went mad and killed the Móra riSéwi leader, which triggered the petrified child to destroy a portion of the royal district with a baby meadow.\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin fled the city, migrating southeast across the Sarvaran gulf on rafts, and eventually settled in an area inhabited by Austerkin minikin. In an attempt to settle down and get some stability once more, they mingled with some of the natives and founded the city-state of Sarvara, becoming the Morellic minikin as they interbred with the new people they met.\n\nSome of the natives disliked the newcomers, not bothering to learn their language and choosing to go to battle with them over the resources native to the land. One group of these, the most violent, was the Tsanyana minikin, but there were also two other groups, which interacted with the Morellic minikin in different ways.\n\nIn addition, the Morellic minikin had to take advantage of the new land they found themselves in, unfamiliar with the native animals and fauna, but eventually grew to domesticate an array of fauna and flora.\n## Events\n### Móra riSéwi minikin discover the Tree\nOne day in the early autumn, the Móra riSéwi leader Carsai was foraging for food with her group. They found a clearing in a forest, and discovered a lone tree in the centre, surrounded by tar pits and dead bushes, with a quaint footpath of stones leading to an island in the midst of the tar-swamp.\n\nIt was almost perfect, a footpath and island lit up by sunlight in the middle of a dark forest, and naturally the party came to the centre and discovered that the tree was hollow and thin; you could push you arm through the tree and it could come out of the other end without any resistance.\n\nNonetheless, the would go back to its original shape soon after being disturbed, it appeared as if its components lacked gravity and the only force of nature affecting it was the need to be in one piece. Carsai ripped the tree open however, and was exposed to the ancient dust and fumes within, which poured out like a solid cloud.\n\nWhen the dust cleared and as Carsai held the tree open, her group grasped at the items within the trunk. The items within were shimmering, iridescent and gold, in the shape of acorns, loaves of bread, and small dead animals - none was decomposed, all was perfectly preserved and an instinct within the party told them that it was edible.\n\nOnce the group collected the items in baskets, and the tree closed up once more, they returned to their camp site and unloaded the goods into their hammocks and bags. Carsai was the first to eat the gold food, and almost immediately began coughing; the same fumes and dust that had poured out of the tree was pouring from her mouth and nose, and her eyes turned the same colour as the gas.\n\nThe group didn't know what to do, but only stood back in fear. Soon, however, Carsai seemingly went back to normal, and the group decided quickly to dump the items back into the tree. But by the time they returned to the island, the clearing was empty, no tar swamp, no tree, only grass and bushes. In fear they laid down their baskets onto the floor and left the gold food there, and fled immediately.\n\n### Carsai falls ill\nSoon after however, Carsai's condition became more and more unstable. She would break into fits of coughing out the fumes, but would soon go back to normal, just as when she first ate the gold food. Eventually, she was unable to lead effectively, and the group resigned themselves to Nairu for her to recover; Nairu had very good healthcare.\n\nEventually, after a period of a few months to a year, Carsai became bedridden, and was unable to leave her sleep den in the city. Soon after she entered the state, her compatriots developed her symptoms, and even the native Nairuans did.\n\n### Ykutru and many die\nNot long after the symptoms appeared in the populus, they died, turning hollow with a thin surface, their sorry bodies disappearing when no one was looking. Carsai didn't die, her strength as a leader was matched by her strength as a body, and she was hanging on by a thread, still encouraging her compatriots.\n\nIn addition, Ykutru also died; Ykutru was the twin sister of the co-regnant Ajun, they were the two deformed twin queens of the city at the time. Ajun was horrified; her city, her twin sister, all gone. Not only this, but also the magical implications.\n\nTwins share one soul, but the [magic energy](phenomena/alucinara.md) contained within the soul is enough to fill two bodies.

Unfortunately, the side effects still include insanity, violent irritability, and sometimes partial phantasmarrhoea.\n\nAjun was now a husk of her former self, she lost almost everything, her mind, her sister, a portion of her population, but she still had her power - she still had the ability to order people to make things right.

Ajun had heard the rumours of Carsai's 'guilt,' that she was Patient 0 and in her insnaity blamed her for every wrong thing. She left her royal tree to climb up Carsai's; Ajun killed her in cold blood, in front of the entire group.\n\nLittle did she know, the Móra riSéwi were a very spiritual tribe, and had knowledge of how to interface with deities, and there was one of many [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) staring directly at the queen.\n\n### The Petrified Child destroys Ajun\nThe petrified child, knowing immediately of the evil that had took place before one of its 'eyes,' made a bee line from its dwelling place to the city of Nairu. Ajun didn't stand a chance against the child's perfect judgement; she and her guards to tried to fend the child off were swiftly turned into baby sludge.\n\nA baby meadow was formed from the evil and corruption, political and literal, of the royalty. The city finally fell, cast into chaos. Whosoever wasn't killed by Carsai's plague, was lost to the baby sludge, and those who were further away were either trampled or died in some other fashion in the chaos of people attempting to escape.\n\nThe Móra riSéwi minikin eventually managed to escape, with many causalities to the petrified child and to the plague already. Carsai's eldest daughter, Bjáura, was rendered queen immediately and, taking after her mother, led the group to safety with authority and confidence.

The natives who had treated the Móra riSéwi minikin well were let into their new city-state, given hospitality as they had given them.\n\n![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144929.png)\n\n#### Castes\nSarvara developed a caste system, with the 'Native' and the 'Móra riSéwi' castes emerging. As the two groups interbred, the castes were handed down matrilineally, but the genetic makeup of the two groups evened out as time went along, leading to the creation of the Sarvaran race, made up of a hybrid of the Móra riSéwi and Austerkin races. A new name was fashioned for the Sarvaran group, the *Morellic* minikin.\n\n### The Tsañána Minikin\nThe warring natives, however, were ostracised, and had their tails cut off at the first chance by the Móra riSéwi military. They were noticeable for their retention of native Austerkin characteristics, namely hairiness and their native language. They stayed in their own city-states, treating the Morellic natives with suspicion and the non-native Morellic minikin with outright prejudice.\n\nTheir nation is to the south of Sarvara, and they are an Un Ntúğa tribe. Following the arrival of the Morellic minikin, they made their own name, to differentiate themselves from the newcomers, and dubbed themselves the 'Tsañána,' meaning 'true people,' as opposed to the Öpfádṛh or Morellic minikin.\n### The Öpfádṛh Minikin\nThe Öpfádṛh minikin are an Austerkin tribe situated to the west of Sarvara, they are closely related to the Tsañána minikin, but don't share their warlike habits; they rather see the Morellic minikin as unimportant and generally tend to trade items within themselves, uninterested in interactions with other tribes.\n\nBeing related to the Tsañána minikin, they are similarly a part of the larger 'Un Ntúğa' group.\n### The Un Ntúğa Minikin\n'Un Ntúğa' Minikin is the title given to the family of Öpfádṛh and Tsañána minikin. Un Ntúğa wasn't a tribe by the time the Morellic minikin arrived, but rather a cladistic title given to both groups who share a common ancestry. However, it used to be a tribe before.\n\nThe late Un Ntúğa tribe was a very large tribe, spanning an area southwest and south of the Sarvaran gulf. They were so large in fact, that two subgroups began to form within them and diverge due to lack of interaction, despite sharing a similar culture.\n\nThe Öpfádṛh group existed to the west, and Tsañána the east; this tribal division was set in stone once the Morellic minikin arrived, as the Tsañána minikin grew angry and jealous of their use and abuse to the local resources, and even angrier at their sibling group for not caring.\n\nOnce the tribal division was laid, and the Tsañána became more and more warlike in a time of political unrest, they began to war with not only the Morellic minikin but also the Öpfádṛh, seeing their small cultural differences as evil and unnatural diversions from *true* tradition, that they weren't *true* people, like the Tsañána.\n### The Kaśtai̋ra Minikin\nThe Kaśtaïra minikin are a Śutéäqṇ minikin tribe situated to the east of Sarvara. They used to be one with the native Morellic minikin, but naturally and uneventfully diverged as the cultural differences grew larger and the western Śutéäqṇ minikin became more and more interested in being incorporated into Morellic society.\n\nThe eastern Kaśtai̋ra were largely disinterested with joining the tribe due to their geographic distance and western-cultural disinterest, but they rather saw the Morellic minikin as a valuable friend, a 'sister in law' on a kind of national scale of sorts, and grew to have a healthy trade relationship with the new tribe.\n### The Śutéäqṇ Minikin\nSimilar to the Un Ntúğa minikin, the Śutéäqṇ minikin is a late tribe and modern grouping of tribes; The Śutéäqṇ minikin contain the Kaśtai̋ra minikin as well as the Morellic minikin, in that the native portion of Morellic genetics is traced back to the Śutéäqṇ tribe.\n\nThe Kaśtai̋ra minikin split off from the native Morellic minikin a while before the non-native Morellic minikin arrived, in fact. They had grew to naturally split, the Kaśtai̋ra being to the east-most portion of the Śutéäqṇ territory and the native Morellic minikin being on the border with the former border of the Tsañána.\n\nAs the Móra riSéwi minikin arrived, the tribal division was reinforced with the western Śutéäqṇ minikin being subsumed into the Morellic tribe, and the Kaśtai̋ra tribe eventually became its own solid separate group following the development out of the Śutéäqṇ tribe.\n\n## Morellic Trade Relationships\nThe Morellic Minikin, living in Sarvara and neighbouring villages, have a lot of their own resources and need a lot of foreign resources. For example, the Morellic minikin lack fair-weed plant fibre, lapis alucinarii, and wormpigs in the area they had settled; and all of these things are found in the areas inhabited by the Morellic peoples' neighbours.\n### To the Tsañána\nTrade with the Tsañána is almost non-existent through official means, and no Tsañána ruler in their right might would ever let the Morellic minikin trade with their subjects. However, there is a black market between the two groups, where trade is acceptable, encouraged, and illegal.\n\nThe Morellic minikin import lapis alucinarii from the Tsañána area, illegally buying it for great amounts for use in royal temples and high-class architecture, where money can be spent and appearances are valuable; lapis alucinarii is a beautiful mineral made of alucinarium with gold veins travelling through it; it is commonly used by the Morellic minikin in ornamentation and spiritual idols.\n\nTrade *from* the Morellic minikin to the Tsañána minikin was quite different however; a lot of the resources that the Tsañána felt was stolen from them was largely stolen by the Tsañána armies, and not traded.\n### To the Öpfádṛh\nTrade with the Öpfádṛh was mainly for their animals, the ecosystem cultivated and helped by the Öpfádṛh was very fruitful and led to great wealth among the group. They export various livestock animals to the Morellic minikin, sending them wormpigs, quartz-mice (imported from the -2nd realm), and many other livestock animals that are non-native to the Sarvaran area.\n\nThe Morellic export to the Öpfádṛh things such as Silklet nests, silklet silk, and fabric. There is an abundance of silklets in Sarvara, which are domesticated, farmed, and sold to the west, leading to a vibrant Silklet husbandry industry within Sarvara.\n### To the Kaśtai̋ra\nThe Kaśtai̋ra minikin export fair-weed plant fibre to the Morellic minikin; due to the different habitat afforded to the Kaśtai̋ra minikin, fair-weed grows a lot more abundantly and in a lot better quality compared to Sarvara and the surrounding area. Fair-weed fibre is woven into royal garments, appearing with a light-yellow colour when not dyed.\n\nThe Morellic minikin export to the Kaśtai̋ra animals such as Weasels. Weasels are used by the minikin of the area as cavalry, they are a common sight on the Morello-Tsañána battlefield. Weasels are essentially only native to the Morellic and Tsañána area.\n\nThe Morellic minikin farm and sell weasels to the Kaśtai̋ra among other groups at points, but the Tsañána are very stingy with their weasels and tend to train them only for battle and never allow themselves to lose even one valuable weasel. \n\nEven so, weasels are very expensive and the Morellic weasel farmers are very rich for their products, listing them for high prices due to their importance to the military and the great danger a minikin puts themselves in to train a weasel for domestic or military use.\n\n## Animals of the 2nd Realm\n## Weasels\nWeasels are essentially the same in the 2nd realm as in the 0th, originating from the Supernova of 80MB, but since then have developed an extra pair of legs with the help of alucinarium and a greater ability to leap. They are domesticated by Minikin for use in battle, as they would usually hunt minikin.\n\nMinikin, being smart, noticed this, and began to weaponise them against their neighbours, eventually training them and treating them as pets once the aggression was bred out of them by skilled pastoralists. Now, they are largely used as cavalry in the military.\n\nOne or two minikin soldiers will sit upon a weasel's back, supported by the 3rd pair of legs, and charge at the enemy, holding spears in their hands or using [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy to levitate daggers and sharp objects forward into the enemy, like a spear or arrow.\n\nIt is an iconic sight to see a soldier or two sitting upon a weasels back, with only a rug-like cloth separating the rider from its steed, with an array of levitating darts above the rider's head floating in an arc, ready to be shot forward in a burst of magic.\n\nSoldiers will typically hold both hands out, facing upward, to direct the magic to the daggers, flicking their hand forward to signal the darts to fire. Soldiers undergo training to increase their Alucinarium Reserve, and to resist the effects of Phantasmarrhoea.\n## Silklets\nSilklets are a type of insect native to the 2nd realm, more specifically to places such as the Morellic area. IN their larval stage, they take the form of relatively large grubs, wriggling and being fed by farmers in specialised shelters made out of clay under tree branches.\n\nBefore they become adults, they continually grow a fleece of silk, which is shaved by farmers and sold to weavers. Once they do become adults, a portion of them are set aside to mate by the farmers if they had an especially fruitful coat as a larva. The majority, however, are killed and fed to Wormpigs once they reach adulthood and no longer produce silk.\n\nThey appear as large dragonflies as adults, and appear as large featureless grubs as larvae.\n## Wormpigs\nWormpigs are a species native to the 2nd realm, more specifically to places such as the Öpfádṛh area, related to the wormwolves of the -3rd. Unlike their vicious carnivorous cousins, wormpigs are rather very docile and mostly herbivorous, and were eventually domesticated by the minikin for their meat as a livestock animal.\n\nIt is a common sight to see a wormpig farm at the foot of a Minikin's tree, with the wormpigs grazing and being fed with food such as leaves and bark dropped by farmers from the branches.\n\nWormpigs are actually not one organism, but two, with a symbiote organism constituting the legs, essentially, and a worm-like host organism that sits atop the back of the symbiote, using its legs for movement and paying it back in nutrition and everything it needs to survive, with a strong organic adhesive connecting the two creatures and highly vascularised and permeable tissue allowing for diffusion of compounds between the organisms.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["ct"]},"/private/crystalline-tales/ct3":{"title":"Crystalline Tales Episode 3","content":"%%\nWhat will we be doing in this note?\nWhat things are important to be mentioned and affect the evevnts?\nHow do the events happen, and what influences them?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nIn this note, we will be describing the specifics of Sarvara, its rise, its features, and its politics. \n\n## Notes\n- \n- \n- \n\n## Context\nThe Mora riSewi minikin migrated southeast from the northwest of the sarvaran gulf following the plague in nairu, started by their former leader Carsai. Carsai died and her eldest daughter Bjáura was appointed queen, just before the migration.\n\nOnce they reached land, they began to interact with the natives who all responded in different ways to their presence. the western Kaśtaïra were subsumed into the Mora riSewi tribe, becoming the Morellic tribe as time went on. \n## Events\n## The Mora riSewi Minikin Arrive\nThe Mora riSewi minikin arrived on the shore of the Sarvaran gulf, frantically running into the wilderness at the final sight of land. Then they met the local natives nearby, the western Kaśtaïra minikin, who gave them hospitality.\n\nRunning and screaming in a foreign language, the Mora riSewi minikin were taken into the western Kaśtaïra trees, dens, and villages, set about fires and finally given a moment to relax, eat, and attempt to explain the situation in their indecipherable tongue.\n\n### The Counsel of Mora riSewi Refuge\nAs the situation became apparent, the matriarchs of the western Kaśtaïra clans all came together to discuss the matter. They accepted the Mora riSewi minikin in on the condition that they would be cast out by the time they built their own villages, as not to burden their tribe with another group to feed.\n\nIn addition, the matriarchs also decreed that the Mora riSewi minikin should be taught how to build cities, as their nomadic tradition only passed down the knowledge of building temporary bases, not built to last. In fact, it was the Kaśtaïra minikin who taught the Mora riSewi how to build clay dens, by showing them how to find clay and store it in their cheeks.\n## Interbreeding into the Morellic People\nAs the Mora riSewi minikin settled down in the western Kaśtaïra villages, they naturally began to interbreed and intermarry into the native populations. Continually, every year or so, the matriarchs would convene once more to discuss the Mora riSewi's progress, and asses whether it was time to drive them out.\n### The Mora riSewi Language\nKnowing that they were to be driven out at some point, the matrilineally Mora riSewi minikin retained knowledge of their language, and it wasn't subsumed by the native Kaśtaïra language although a lot of loanwords were gained.\n\n### The Departure of the Mora riSewi Minikin\nOnce the matriarchs decided it was time for the Mora riSewi minikin to leave, they had ultimately kained their knowledge of how to found a city not through being taught but through interbreeding into the population; their ability was defined by the fact that they were now partially native to a society that *isn't* nomadic.\n\nAnd once it was time to be driven out, there was no ostracism. A lot of people had the claim to stay, being (partially or completely) native, but a lot of Mora riSewi minikin had so much respect for the matriarchs and for recent history that they did decide to leave and found their own city to preserve the Mora riSewi legacy.\n\nThe ones to depart became the Morellic minikin, a cultural and genetic merge of the settlers and the native Kaśtaïra minikin, who gained their own more distinct cultural identity once they left and settled in Sarvara.\n\n## The Search for Sarvara\nWhen the Mora riSewi minikin had arrived, they arrived close by to the great river Abhmýra. This river, situated in the midst of a very beautiful river valley, was talked about quite a lot once they had settled in the Kaśtaïra settlements. Of course, these stories were relayed to the migrators' children, and gained a semi-mythical status.\n\nSo of course, when it was time to leave, the new Morellic minikin left for the river valley. Having heard stories of the location first hand from their parents, uncorrupted by such a short time-span, they knew the way to get there and employed a lot of knowledge of the area as Kaśtaïra descendants to find it.\n\n## The Founding of Sarvara\nEventually, they did. After a few months march across the wilderness, the matriarch of the Morellic minikin, Kallaśí daughter of Bjáura, found the Sarvaran river valley with her tribe. They named the settlement and the river 'Sarvara,' meaning 'Our River' in Old Morellic, referring to their inherent entitlement to the area as the ones who mythologised and found it.\n\nThe valley, very green, in a largely dry steppe, exhibited the sparkling blue colour of the very wide river with a large eyot in the centre; the eyot featured a large tree in the centre, the tree told in the stories. Knowing the river was very conducive for fertile soil, they almost immediately leaped upon the banks and collected clay for their tree-dens.\n\nKallaśí's servants, especially the Kaśtaïran architects, also immediately pounced upon the large tree at their queen's order and began to build dens, platforms, and rooms fit for royalty upon the tree's nooks and branches. The tree was adored with beautiful clay den architecture, gemstones, and magical implements to increase the awe that the royal tree (a palace, essentially) provided.\n### Its Development\nThe development of Sarvara was greatly accelerated by the continual flooding of the Sarvara river. The minikin would build their supply dens in the trees, same with their sleeping dens, and packed clay down onto the upside of the branches to provide smooth walkways. They also added bridges, stairs, and magical floating stepping stones across the branches and trees through the air to increase accessibility.\n\nThey made a point not to build directly upon the floor where the flood could damage their stores, and only built their farms and sowed their crops within the reach of the flood. Preceding the flood season, they would sow their crops, and after the flood season they would harvest their crops once they grew to maturity.\n\n#### Hibernation\nIn the winter, they would all store their yield, and have a large feat together as a tribe. Each tree would be lit up by magical candles as everybody sat down to eat with each other, and once the feast was over at midnight they would all resign themselves to their hibernatory dens and sleep all the way through to the pre-flood season.\n\n## Sarvaran Oligarchy\nAs the city-state developed, it became clearer and clearer that such a centralised monarchical governmental system was not viable, especially as the city grew and more Morellic towns were being built nearby. So after a while, Kallaśí appointed an array of 8 oligarchs to rule over different portions of the city and surrounding areas. These oligarchs were all chosen from the most important and influential families, each being the matriarch of their respective house.\n\nEssentially, these people were given a lot of control over their own district to enforce rules, imprison, and alter the way things work in their respective areas. Their subjects would pay taxes to them, ad half of the money would be given to Kallaśí the queen.\n\nThese oligarchs would convene at the royal tree with the queen, discussing matters such as crime, taxes, citizen loyalty, war with other tribes, among other things. In addition, they were also trained by Kallaśí to be proficient sorcerers; they gained great Alucinara-Endurance and a great knowledge of how to use [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy for their own purposes as people in power.\n\nHowever, they all had their heads and all of their fur shaven. this was to show their loyalty to Sarvara, as Squirrels were worshipped and revered religiously in Morellic society, and fur was seen as a connection to their divine ancestors. It showed a great amount of loyalty to forsake one's connection to their religion in place of a show of commitment to their country, despite how embarrassing it may have seemed.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[""]},"/species/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDemi-Slugs are a nomadic sapient gastropod species native to the 1st realm. They are herbivores, eating leaves and soft plant tissue. They live in societies built around the ceremonial and survivalistic foraging of plants and defense from other animals.\n\n## Adaptations\nAfter the Supernova of 80MB, a great portion of slugs were shifted into the 1st realm. These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to alucinarium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["species","fauna","slug"]},"/species/fauna/djidjit":{"title":"Djidjit","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["species","fauna","skipper"]},"/species/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDragons, native to the 2nd realm, are a small amphibian species capable of flight.

They are arboreal omnivores which tend toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They are capable of language, and appear anthropoid.\n\n## Adaptation\nMany red squirrels that had found themselves in the 2nd realm as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and are subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;\n- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,\n- greater agility and capacity for stealth,\n- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.\n\n## Morphology\nMinikin measure at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same alucinara energy that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Morellic Race\n\n### Austerkin Race\nThe Austerkin are a lot hairier compared to other minikin races.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution can vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tends to have hair, and the tail is fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin are almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin are hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour can vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour can vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tend to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's den(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or dens.\n\nModern minikin groups inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees are often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commits a crime, they are ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails are seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and disconnection from the soul is representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' can vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group is too large for one community, it inevitably collapses. A varying amount of groups form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups are often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucinarium secretion and frequencial shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, are greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernate in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin become unconscious in a sleep-like state, and alucinarium levels in the brain increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protect the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis is not seen in normal sleep, but is shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucinarium in the brain during hibernation is a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["species","fauna","rodent","featured"]},"/species/fauna/silkmoths":{"title":"silkmoths","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[]},"/species/fauna/snails":{"title":"snails","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/botanists":{"title":"Botanists","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nBotanists grew to inhabit the 3rd realm, and they buckled the trend of *animals* taking the sentient role in an ecosystem. In fact, Botanists are plants; rather than eating, they employ Alucinaratrophy, absorbing alucinara energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.\n\nThey did little to adapt to their surroundings, apart from the development of toxins and thorns to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat them. Rather, the bulk of their evolution came from the bombardment of alucinara they recieved during their development, speeding up the process and applying drastic physiological changes.\n\nThe botanists took on a radial body plan, with 6 to 8 thorned roots at the bottom of their bodies. Once reaching maturity, these roots would leave the ground and serve as legs, so that the botanists cold place their seeds far away. In addition, they featured a skirt of very many leaves specialised for alucinaratrophy and four eyes on stalks around a long tendril that laid retracted in a mouth-like pouch on a long thorned neck at the top of the body. The tendril would come out when object manipulation was needed, or when it was time to release seeds, which would also be stored in the pouch.\n\nThe botanists had a semi-sophisticated society, mirroring insects such as ants or termites, where all will serve a purpose in the colony, communicating with the use of pheromones released from the mouth-pouch. Colonies would be planted by a group of mature botanists, plunging their tendrils into the soil to lay their seeds deep in the ground, which wouch eventually grow into a patch and go on to plant more and more colonies.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":["species","fauna","fernfolk"]},"/species/flora/skunkfruit":{"title":"skunkfruit","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/thirrist":{"title":"thirrist","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T21:37:53.62529734Z","tags":[]},"/species/fungi/mushrooms":{"title":"Mushrooms","content":"\n## Overview\nMushrooms are the fruiting bodies of many fungal species.
