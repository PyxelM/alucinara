It causes those affected, known as Phantasms, to experience irreversable physical and mental effects, leading to the growth of Alucinarium on the body and psychosis.\n## Contraction\nPhantasmarrhoea is contracted through exposure to more [Alucinara energy](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) than the body can handle, varying depending on the levels of exposure and one's immunity to the adverse effects of Alucinara.\n## Symptoms\nThe many symptoms of Phantasmarrhoea are marked by:\n- The accumulation of Alucinarium in the body and on the skin\n- Infertility\n- Hair loss, or Alopecia\n- Hallucinations\n- Psychosis, paranoia, and violent, antisocial behaviour \n- Pale, purple skin and eyes\n- Skin irritation, rashes, and pain\n- Blindness\n- Essential Shift into the infra-essent realms.\n## Appearance\nPhantasms' appearance is defined by harsh crystals growing all across their bodies, originating at the hands, feet, and tail. Furthermore, any exposed skin is generally pink, translucent, and pale, with blood vessels visible from beneath the surface, and their eyes are often pale, with a pink tint. They are often accompanied by orbs and sparks of light, through which they see, once blindness has set into the eyes.\n## Behaviour\nPhantasms are deeply violent toward other living beings, using the razor-sharp Alucinarium crystals that grow upon their body to scratch and attack others. In addition, their violent behaviour leads them to live solitary, lonely lives in the infra-essent realms.\n## Noteable Phantasms\n- Ketton, father of Riverbed, and founder of the Afortuitous Order","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["conditions","alucinara"]},"/conditions/sharadism":{"title":"Sharadism","content":"## Overview\nSharadism is a physiological condition that affects organic beings. It causes those affected, known as Sharadith[^1], to undergo many irreversable physical, mental, and spiritual changes, resulting in a grotesque appearance and insatiable need to consume the blood and flesh of others.\n## Spiritual Effects\nThe effects of contraction of Sharadism on the soul are markedly drastic. Those affected lose possession of their souls, which return to the pond, and rather the Sharadic Angel sends down its own spirit into the bodies of the Sharadith.\n\nAs the Sharadith's souls are extensions of the Sharadic Angel, and thus holy in the eyes of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), they have the capability of committing evil acts (such as murder, cannibalism, and exsanguination) without alerting the Child to destroy them.\n## Contraction\nSharadism is contracted when an organic being is exposed to the bodily fluids of a carrier. Only few carriers are largely symptomless, integrating into society without a problem, and without their condition being discovered.\n\nA common method of contraction is the consumption of tainted animal meat or plant flesh, such as from a hunted animal with Sharadism, or a foraged plant which has gained the condition from contact with another Sharadh.\n\nAnother method is through the deliberate turning of another being. This is customary in some Minikin cultures as criminal punishment, but can also be carried out when a Sharadh pack dwindles in number and the remaining members seek out new recruits. This is achieved through bites or scratches, which penetrate the skin, but do not kill the victim.\n## Turning\nWhen one contracts Sharadism, they don't fully transform into a Sharadh until the night after, usually in their sleep. In this sleep, they appear dead, but don't decompose beyond a pale and dry appearance. Once the transformation is complete, they appear as a Sharadh, and can infect others.\n## Appearance\nSharadith differ in appearance from their healthy counterparts, in that they exhibit:\n- Greater accumulaton of haemoglobin and red iron pigments in the body, leading to a ruddy appearance and red eyes.\n- Complete hair loss or alopecia universalis.\n- A larger body, with longer, sinewy limbs, and thicker nails, due to greater secretion of growth hormones.\n- Stronger bones and teeth, due to remineralisation and greater calcium consumption.\n- Sharper teeth and fingernails, due to a pathological compulsion to file or sharpen them.\n## Behaviour and Pathology\nThe behaviour of Sharadith also differs from their healthy counterparts, as they exhibit:\n- A lack of interest in socialising with others or associating with civilisation, prefering to stay in small, matriarchal groups of other Sharadith.\n- Infertility, leading to new Sharadith being turned only through contraction\n- Unpredictable and socially unacceptable behaviour, hallucinations, confusion, ceaseless anger, and insatiable hunger.\n- Avoidance of cooked or plant-based foodstuffs, preferring wholly to consume raw meat, bones, and blood.\n- Extreme heliophobia and pyrophobia, leading to nocturnal sleeping patterns.\n\n[^1]:**Sarvaran**: Singular *Carádh*, Paucal *Cáradaqh*, Plural *Cáradith* \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic \\*Syazad, meaning 'exsanguinator.'","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["conditions"]},"/conditions/sorcerism":{"title":"Sorcerism","content":"## Overview\nSorcerism is a condition that grants those affected with the ability to manipulate the laws of nature through the use of Alucinara. Sorcerism is more common than uncommon, with more than one subtype.\n## Types\n### Asorcerism\nAsocerism is the condition of lacking the ability to use Alucinara energy. It is commonly caused by spiritual curses, or a congenital or aquired defect in the fortuitary gland, meaning that Alucinarium is unable to be produced by the body, or the spirit is unable to control the energy around it.\n\nAsorcerism is a condition brought about by the body, as living beings' ability to use Alucinara is limited by the effectiveness of their fortuitary gland. Thus, this effectiveness can be checked by injury, age, or by the intervention of angels or powerful sorcerers.\n### Low Sorcerism\nLow sorcerism is the most common subtype of sorcerism, and is the natural state of many species. This type leads those affected to have some level of control over Alucinara energy, and is commonly used for telekinesis, pyrokinesis, energy magic, and to commune with deities.\n### High Sorcerism\nHigh sorcerism, the most uncommon subtype, leads those affected to have an intense degree of control over Alucinara energy. This control can be intentional, instinctual, or inintentional, and is commonly used in order to prophesy, levitate, and cast spells more intensely, or for long periods of time, among other grand effects.\n## Sorcerers\nSorcerers are those who use alucinara energy, and are commonly shamans, healers, priests, warriors, and prophets. Their place in society is commonly contextualised by their condition, and they would largely take jobs and vocations according to their magical abilities.\n### Dark Sorcerers\nSome sorcerers would use their powers for evil, out of faith for unrighteous angels, or for their own unrighteous reasons. These dark (and less often, righteous) sorcerers would commonly have some form of deformity from prolonged exposure to Alucinara, including [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md) or mutations, leading them to have a crusty, bald, animalistic appearance.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["conditions","alucinara"]},"/fauna/bushdeer":{"title":"Bushdeer","content":"## Overview\nBushdeer are a genus of deer native to the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and -1st realms. They are herbivores descended from Sika deer, but feature kleptoplastic shrubbery on their antlers and skeleton-like fur patterns. They inhabit the plains and continental forests of [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md).\n## Appearance\nBushdeer can vary in height according to species, from 30cm to 1m at the shoulder. They feature dark, brown fur, with green mossy patches, and a white fur pattern that mimics exposed bone, causing the bushdeer to appear rotten and inedible to predators. Their antlers are covered by kleptoplastic leaves, allowing the bushdeer not only to camouflage in the greenery, but also photosynthesise during periods of cessation.\n## Species\nSome species of Bushdeer are large and muscular, living on the ground, in plains, forests, and sometimes rocky habitats. In contrast, some species are smaller, such as the pygmy bushdeer, which is specialised for an arboreal lifestyle, blending in with the canopy.\n## Behaviour\nBushdeer behaviour is defined by periods of hibernation and apparent death. Not only do they  hibernate in the winter as their metabolism slows down and they are sustained by photosynthesis, but they also play dead when threatened. They are kept safe by their markings that deter would-be predators.\n\nFurthermore, male bushdeer are greatly territorial, using their sharp hooves and antlers to attack mating competition and other animals that trespass into the deer's territory. Females are likewise violent, protecting their young from predators and using [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to force them from harm's way.\n## Hunting\nBushdeer are hunted by some [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) groups where their territories overlap; for example, pygmy bushdeer are an ideal prey animal due to the ease required to hunt them compared to bulkier species. Their 'leaves' are a delicacy in many Minikin cultures, being used in meals such as salads and stews alongside other meats and true leaves.\n## Diet\nBushdeer have a herbivorous diet, consuming mainly leaves, weeds, flowers, and fruit. It is from their diet that they gain the chloroplasts needed to photosynthesise.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","infra-essent-realms","ultra-essent-realms"]},"/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"## Overview\nDemi-Slugs are a species of hermaphroditic gastropod mollusks native to the 1st realm. They are terrestrial, semi-anthropoid herbivores descended from the Great Grey Slug. They are the most populous and intelligent race of the 1st realm, and are capable of their own distinct form of speech, agriculture, [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) use, and civilisation.\n## Appearance\nDemi-Slugs are 20cm tall at maturity, from their foot to their head. They feature 2 pneumostomes at the base of their neck, a mollusk foot, and 4 tentacle-like arms. They have smooth, wet, grey-brown skin with black spots, and are entirely hairless.\n## Children\nDemi-Slug children are miniscule, only about 1cm in length when they hatch from their eggs. They are fed a solution of specialised mucus from their parents, similar to milk in mammals, containing nutrients, protien, and glucose for the child to grow and thrive. Many demi-slug children perish young, so litters can reach up to 50 eggs in one spawning.\n## Behaviour\nDemi-Slugs are crepuscular, awake in the twilight of dusk and dawn, and only come out in humid or wet weather. They spend their time in semi-subterranean complexes, collecting mud in their mouths which they use to fortify walls and create structures above-ground.\n\nThey generally build these complexes in wetland climates or nearby water sources such as oases and springs. This allows them a humid climate where they are unlikely to dessicate and perish, and where they can easily hydrate themselves.\n### Language\nThey utilise [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to generate tones and rhythms by telekinetically vibrating an organ within their bodies which they use to communicate, attenuating these tones with their pneumostomes. This allows them to communicate with species with different speech anatomy, such as [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), by replicating the sound of their speech.\n## Diet\nDemi-Slugs are herbivorous, consuming living and rotting plant matter such as leaves, vegetables, wood, fruit, and seeds. Some civilisations grind down and / or dehydrate food for later use, rehydrating them with nearby water sources.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","demi-slug","ultra-essent-realms","sapient-species"]},"/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"## Overview\nDragons are a genus of amphibians native to the -1st, -3rd, and all ultra-essent realms, including the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md). They are omnivorous, flight-capable through the use of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md), and semi-aquatic, inhabiting wetlands, rivers, swamps, lakes, and oases. They are inedible and toxic, but are often hunted for use in pigments and dyes. Dragons are omnivorous, consuming algae, leaves, and mainly insects.\n## Appearance\nDragons can vary in appearance based on species and environment, but are generally wet-skinned and long, with a body like a worm or a salamander, six short legs, and two large eyes on the top of their heads. Dragon species capable of flight lack physical wings, rather using [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy, but exhibit wing-like apparitions during flight.\n## Species\nThere are many species of Dragon which specialise into different behaviours, elements, and uses of Alucinara.\n### Water Dragons\nWater Dragons are almost entirely aquatic, unnable to survive out of water for long, inhabiting swamps and wetlands. This species has webbed, fin-like feet, electric organs, and exposed gills similar to axolotls, with blue skin and light counter-shading on their underside. Furthermore, this species is capable of generating electricity to stun threats, and can sense electric fields.\n### Fire Dragons\nFire Dragons are a flight-capable species of Dragon which inhabit steppes and deserts of the -1st realm, using [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy to generate lift and flames which they breathe from their mouths. This species has rough, brown, durable skin, which protects them from the elements.\n### Earth Dragons\nEarth Dragons are flightless, living on land in rainforests. They are effective mimickers of nature, camouflaging themselves against rock, sand, and dirt.\n### Leaf Dragons\nLeaf dragons are a subspecies of flight-capable earth dragon which inhabit the canopy. They use kleptoplasty to photosynthesise, using many small leaf-like organs on their back to catch sunlight.\n### Magic Dragons\nMagic Dragons are flight-capable and inhabit the forests and plains of the -3rd realm. They have a greater ability to withstand the energy of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md), owing to their habitat. They use alucinara in order to manipulate objects, speak, and confuse predators.\n## Life Cycle\nDragons lay their spawn in damp, wet, areas, such as ponds. Their eggs are mainly found in wet climates, such as rainforests, but it is not uncommon for them to migrate elsewhere later in life.\n\nThey begin life in a tadpole-like nymph phase in which they live in their ponds and feed upon plant matter, eventually maturing, growing their limbs, opening their eyes, and leaving the water for the first time.\n\nTheir adult phase is around a few years long; they travel over vast distances in search of food and a mate, eventually returning to their birthplace to lay their own eggs, before they pass away soon after.\n## Uses\nDragons are toxic to consume, and aren't hunted for food. Rather, they are hunted by most [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) cultures for their use in dyes and hallucinogenic intoxicants, which are used in textiles, religious rituals, and drugs.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","ultra-essent-realms","infra-essent-realms"]},"/fauna/flying-squirrels":{"title":"Flying Squirrels","content":"## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","ultra-essent-realms","livestock"]},"/fauna/giant-snails":{"title":"Giant Snails","content":"## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","infra-essent-realms","ultra-essent-realms","draught-animal"]},"/fauna/great-bees":{"title":"Great Bees","content":"## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","ultra-essent-realms","livestock"]},"/fauna/minikin":{"title":"Minikin","content":"## Overview\nMinikin (spp. *Anthrosciurus sapiens*) are a species of small rodents native to the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). They are anthropoid, arboreal omnivores descended from the European Red Squirrel. They are the most populous and intelligent race of the 2nd realm, and are capable of speech, agriculture, [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) use, and civilisation.\n## Appearance\nThere is a lot of variation in terms of Minikin appearances, due to genetic diversity. Generally, they are 25-30cm tall, bipedal and anthropoid, with a snouted face, pointed ears, a long, bushy tail, and 4-fingered hands and digitigrade feet, with sharp claws and specialised teeth for tearing flesh and grinding plant matter.\n\nFur distributions and skin colour varies with the climate; for example, a Minikin from a hotter climate may have less fur and darker skin, whereas a Minikin from a colder climate may have more fur and lighter skin. Likewise, eye colour and hair colour can vary accordingly.\n### Dimorphism\nMinikin males tend to be taller than women, about 30 cm in height, and more bulky. Women, in contrast, lack as much hair as males (such as nose hair) and reach a stature of about 25 cm.\n### Children\nMinikin children are small, about 5cm in length, and more squirrel-like than their elders. They are hairless at birth, but quickly grow out a thick coat of fur across the body, which permanently sheds before sexual maturity.\n## Diet\nMinikin are omnivores, mainly eating a diet of small mammals, fruit (and their juice), amphibians, vegetables, fish, leaves, and tree bark; and after the invention of agriculture, minikin began to eat and drink bread, beer, and wine.\n\nEating is a social experience for Minikin, who mainly do so with family, friends, and lovers. They don't do so with those they don't trust, as it is an experience where one can let down their guard, without fear of being attacked or poisoned.\n## Predators\nMinikin are an ideal prey animal for their small size, but are formidable for their smart intellect and use of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md). They are hunted by various animals, which they often worship and / or venerate, such as [widrens](fauna/widrens.md), [weasels](fauna/weasels.md), and [direwolves](private/trash/fauna/direwolves.md).\n## Sociology\nMinikin are a very social species, living in familial groups or clans. Due to the mother's importance within Minikin families, many cultures are matriarchal.\n\nAt the advent of the Minikin Bronze Age, many clans began to unite under a common cultural identity into city states and nations, which would go on to expand, colonise, and build empires.\n### Religion\nMinikin religion, as with the religions of other sapient species, is based upon the worship of the celestial beings; including the Judges, the Petrified Child, and / or the Angels.\n\nThese beings are worshipped on holy days, in holy locations, or in temples, and communed with by those in priestly or high positions within the social heirarchy.\n### Clothing\nMinikin fashion clothing out of leaves, animal skin / leather, plant fibre, and wool; creating tunics, skirts, and coats, among other items of clothing. Weaving was an industry pioneered early in Minikin development.\n### Agriculture\nAngriculture was innovated in Minikin society at many independent points, but generally spells the end of the Neolithic era (or New Stone Age) and the dawn of the Bronze Age.\n\nMinikin use tools such as sticks or scythes to harvest plants, which include Lunuth wheat, Sweetrice, fruit, berries, vegetables, and Pelen.\n### Hunting and Warfare\nFurthermore, Minikin also fashion spears, blades, and clubs in order to defeat prey animals or enemies. Due to the use of [Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy, Minikin do not have use for bows, as they can drive arrows into prey and others by casting a kinetic spell.\n\nSome Minikin domesticate animals such as Weasels in order to ride into battle with other nations, clans, or predators, using their weapons and magic from atop their steed or from the ground in order to succeed against their foe.\n### Structures\nMinikin structures are used for many purposes, such as for homes, places of storage, bath-houses, or temples. They generally constructed these structures with clay, Lunuth straw, wood, bitumen, and stones.\n### Ground-Level\nOn the ground, structures were built on solid ground and otherwise upon flat, stone foundations. These were more often farms, temples, and bathhouses, where waste could be easily taken and used as compost.\n### Farms\nFarms could be built on ground-level or in the canopy, depending on their type. Farms which grew crops such as Lunuth wheat or berries were set up on ground level, where seeds could be sewn. Within the canopy, farms were set up to farm the fruit of the trees, such as Dhajar nuts or Sarkitwara, or the goods of various small animals which inhabited the trees, such as silk from silkworms or moths.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","minikin","ultra-essent-realms","sapient-species"]},"/fauna/silkworms":{"title":"silkworms*","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":[]},"/fauna/snoutgoats":{"title":"Snoutgoats","content":"## Overview\nSnoutgoats are a species of small, semi-arboreal goats native to the 1st and [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md)s, inhabiting the steppes and mountainous areas.

Some snoutgoats were domesticated for their meat and wool.\n## Appearance\nSnoutgoats are 30-45cm tall at the shoulder when mature, with a saiga/tapir-like snout, a soft, light fleece, and two short, curling antlers.\n## Behaviour\nSnoutgoats travel in herds, and protect their young with their lives. They use their large nasal cavity as a resonance chamber, allowing them to amplify their calls across mountainous areas and vast steppes. Furthermore, they use their sharp antlers to challenge mating opponents and predators, but are more likely to flee when given the option.\n## Domestication\nSome snoutgoats were domesticated by some [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) and [demi-slug](fauna/demi-slug.md) groups, and kept as livestock, with their fur used as wool in textiles and their meat used in food. Furthermore, they were sometimes used as mounts, allowing those they trust to ride them.\n## Diet\nSnoutgoats are herbivores, subsisting on grass, leaves, bark, nuts, weeds, moss, and fruit.

Their eyes are large in order to see in the dark, and they are almost completely black from head to toe.\n## Behaviour\nWidren employ the use of many behaviours to survive. They are solitary nocturnal hunters, hunting and surviving alone once they are mature. They make their nests in treetops, and their young are known to fight one another to filter out the weak.

They were domesticated by some minikin groups, especially the [Aqhorans](lore/2nd-realm/aqhor.md), for protection from other predators.\n## Appearance\nWildcats are generally 30cm tall at the shoulder when mature, with a hairy, nimble feline body. Their fur varies from brown to beige depending on the climate, and their teeth, fangs, and tongue are specialised for tearing and clearing meat off of bone. Their eyes are thin and almond shaped, and their cheeks are large and fatty, containing specialised fortuitary glands for offence and protection from [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy.\n## Behaviour\nWildcats are territorial predators who mate for life. They live a semi-arboreal lifestyle, as adept hunters who stalk in not only the branches of the canopy but also the grasses of the steppe. They are solitary, leaving the litter once they reach maturity to hunt alone. However, once two wildcats mate, they team up to protect not only their offspring, but also each other, with their lives.\n## Domestication\nWildcats were domesticated as cats by some brave minikin groups such as the [Aqhorans](lore/2nd-realm/aqhor), who put them to use protecting places such as bases, fortifications, and farms. \n## Diet\nWildcats are carnivores, mainly consuming animals such as rodents, including minikin, mice, rats, and rat-monkeys. By their domesticators, they are generally fed a diet of Lunuth-based fodder and rat monkeys.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.448500137Z","tags":["fauna","infra-essent-realms","ultra-essent-realms","predator"]},"/fauna/wolfrats":{"title":"Wolfrats","content":"## Overview\nWolfrats are a species of carnivorous rodents native to the -1st and -3rd realms.

They were united by a common culture and ethnicity, but saw themselves as very disparate.\n\nThe early Morellic tribes served as the predecessors of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) and [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md), and spoke a continuum of Proto-Morellic dialects, including Old Sarvaran and Old Corothic.\n\nThey were contemporary with the pre-aqhoran tribes, but would not make contact with them until they migrated to the southern coast of Tseireph and founded the city-state of Aqhor at the dawn of the minikin Bronze age.\n## Genetics\nThe early Morellic culture encompassed a few groups below the equator in Tseireph, mainly in the steppe and continental climates. The groups that made up the culture could vary subtly in appearance and identity, but were all united by their common linguistic, cultural, and genetic origin.\n\nSome early Morellic groups included those who lived in the Steppe, who would go on to migrate south and found the city state and civilisation of Sarvara. Another was the Coroth, who lived southeast of the steppe, inhabiting the continental forests of southern Tseireph, and would go on to found their own Corothic civilisation.\n## Clothing Practices\nThe early Morellic tribes wore clothes made of animal hide, fur, leather, woven grass leaves, and plant fibre, such as from Lunuth. They would commonly wear long dress-like tunics, cloaks, belts with pouches, sandals, and jewellery made of bones, shells, volcanic glass, and stones[^2].\n\nThey would not wear more sophisticated fabrics until the bronze age saw great developments in agriculture, namely the domestication of Lunuth wheat and invention of Lunuth fabric. They would sew their hide and leaves together using bone needles and plant fibre, and would commonly dye their clothing colours such as red or orange.\n## Religion\nThe early Morellic religion was decentralised, [angel](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md)-worshipping, and polytheistic. The early Morellic Minikin would make prayers, sacrifice, and worship to these deities, whom they could communicate with in dreams. Each tribe, clan, family would have patron deities who were believed to have a level of influence over the good fortune of their worshippers.\n\nThe chief deity of the early Morellic religion was the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), who protected nature, all things holy, and the innocent. It was believed that the petrified child was the firstborn of the god of nature, known as '*Kherelli*[^1],' and that the other deities were her other children.\n## Calendar\nThe early morellic tribes used variations of a lunisolar calendar called the '*kasuumitvirsu*[^8].' Years were made up of 297 days with 8 day weeks, divided 8 months of 36 days (with an extra intercalary month every 4 years), and began around the start of summer. The early morellic tribes counted a person's age from the month they were born, rather than the day.\n## Cultural Practices\n### Women\nWomen were respected and seen as greatly sacred in Morellic culture. In early Morellic society, it was customary for women to perform ablutions (involving cleansing of the body with water and the shaving of the head and tail) twice every day, symbolising their purity. In addition, women were further respected as spiritual leaders, mothers, and grandmothers.\n\nWomen commonly held high-ranking positions with a high amount of influence, symbolically acting as mothers over their clans, but were also permitted to perform other tasks such as foraging, pottery, and weaving.\n#### Matriarchs\nEarly morellic tribes were made up of clans led by Matriarchs, which tended to be grandmothers, wise beyond their years, ex-spiritual leaders, with great knowledge of sorcery. The matriarchs' authority was mutually agreed upon by the members of each clan, and they were cared for by the spiritual leaders of the group.\n\nFurthermore, their lifespans were prolonged through the use of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md), as the spiritual leaders would feed them aluciferous foods. This led to some matriarchs reaching above 40 years in age upon their deaths, which was rare in minikin, whose lifespan usually reached no more than 25.\n### Men\nMen were less respected than women, but were not oppressed. Men commonly held laborious positions, being hunters, foragers, and potters, but also had the opportunity to become spiritual leaders, elevating their rank in early Morellic society.\n\nSome wise and strong men would leave their clans, searching to find a wife from others in order to increase genetic diversity. Upon finding another group, they would undergo an initiation ritual to join the clan.\n#### Initiation Rituals\nInitiation Rituals, each known as an '*Adhiimnelya*[^7],' were led by the matriarch of the group in order to potentially let in an outsider for marriage. These outsiders would be required to prove themselves, showing endurance of pain, and would ultimately end in either ostracism or marriage to the most compatible bachelorette.\n\nThe tests of endurance included climbing up and down burning dead trees, and being attacked by various stinging insects. The matriarch of the inviting clan would watch, and ultimately decide wether the man seemed fit to enter.\n### Spiritual Leaders\nSpiritual leaders in the early morellic tribes were highly respected shamans, who would counsel, guide, and protect the members of the group. They were the only class permitted to make sacrifices, but they often made them on behalf of others.\n\nIn addition, early Morellic spiritual leaders also sang in choirs and played primitive flutes. Not only would they recite oral tradition in spoken form, but also in song; it was during the early Morellic period that shamanistic polyphonic singing was innovated, an art form expanded upon in later Morellic societies.\n\nFurthermore, the spiritual leaders were skilled not only in advisorship and music, but also sorcery and warfare. They often fought in early, small-scale battles. In Sarvara, they would evolve and split into two castes, that of warriors and priests.\n### Eunuchs\nEunuchs were rare in early morellic society, and were often ostracised from clans. However, this changed in future morellic societies; for example, in Sarvara, Eunuchs were accepted, but treated as adults from the beginning of their life, without the opportunity to live as a child, and mostly served as high-ranking advisors.\n### Sexuality\nSexuality in early morellic culture was not very restrictive. It was seen as normal for men and women to marry, and women commonly held many husbands. It was taboo, however, for men to be polygamous, but they were permitted to have romantic relationships with anybody within the group, regardless of gender.\n\nIt was also taboo for a minikin to be in a marriage or relationship with their immediate cousins, siblings, parent, parents' immediate cousins and siblings, and niblings. However, it was perfectly acceptable to romantically and sexually mingle outside of this group.\n\nFurthermore, the difference between friendship and relationship was blurred in early Morellic society; some friendships were purely platonic, but some included romantic aspects, without being fully-fledged relationships.\n### Marriage\nSpiritual leaders facilitated marriage ceremonies, which were permitted only between women and their husbands. Marriage ceremonies required the participants to wear special clothing, known as '*Byelodjunu*[^6],' and for the bride to recite oral tradition on the nature of marriage.\n\nThe ceremony was completed through covering one of each of the participants' palms with resin, and interlocking that hand with the other (the hands facing the spiritual leader). This symbolises the connection of those married.\n### Coming of Age\nThe early morellic coming of age ritual took place for males on their 6th birthday, and females' 5th, being the ages when the minikin reached the age of maturity and began to be held accountable for their actions. Eunuchs did not perform these rituals.\n#### In Males\nIn males, the coming of age ritual (known as the '*Areyomittakhar*[^3]') was a month-long pilgrimage into the wilderness, where the boy would have to learn to fight, hunt, and survive, symbolising his transition from dependent to independent.\n\nIf the boy survived, the month would end with their reintroduction to their group, with a celebration (known as 'Kulyaannelya[^4]') on the first day of the next month. A boy's *Kulyaanelya* involved the performance of music, a large feast for the whole group, and the boy's consumption of hallucinogenic [Nyuta tea](flora/nyutaberry.md), when he was to commune with the deities and make requests for the future and his life plans.\n#### In Females\nA females's *Areyomittakhar* was a more sophisticated process, where the girl's mothers and aunts would perform ablutions on her twice a day for a month. This symbolised a girls transition into womanhood and prepared the girl for the rituals that came with being an adult woman, which was a sacred position in morellic societies.\n\nOn the first day of the following month was the '\\*Osinnelya[^5],' which was a more private event than a *Kulyaanelya*. The *Sinakasudh* required the girl to recite the oral tradition pertaining to the sanctity of womanhood in front of an audience, after which she would retire home to consume Nyuta tea and perform the same requests as boys on their *Kulyaanelya*.\n\n[^1]: Old Sarvaran \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Kherell-lhi,' meaning 'god of earth;' Cf.

The Sarvaran city and civilisation were located within the Sarvaran river basin, of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) and the [2nd Realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).\n\nSarvara was founded during the Minikin Neolithic era, reaching its height during the Bronze Age, and was one of the first great cities, alongside [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md) and [Aqhor](groups-and-places/aqhor.md). It held a great amount of influence over the river basin, and served as the foundation for its successor state, the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/the-empire-of-the-petrified-child.md).\n## Etymology\nThe name for the city, '*Sarvárą*,' is made up of two roots, '*Sarav*,' the name of a river, and '*Rą*,' meaning 'City \\[of].' The name of the river Sarav was loaned into Old Sarvaran from the native substrate language Old Diiran.\n## Location\nSarvara was built on the Sarav river in the Sarvaran river basin, which was in southern Tseireph, a continent of Kherell in the 2nd Realm. It had a mediterranean climate, with seasonal floods from the river. Aqhor was to the south, and Coroth to the northeast.\n\n![](images/sarvaran-river-basin.png)\n*The Sarvaran River Basin, with the locations of Sarvara, Aqhor, and Coroth.*\n### The River Sarav\nThe river Sarav flows from the northern mountains to the Aqhoran delta (the mouth of the river basin.) It is placed within a mediterranean biome, surrounded by steppes and humid continental biomes, and experiences seasonal floods that greatly enriched the effectiveness of agriculture in the area.\n\nSarvara is one such city built upon it, as is Aqhor built at it's delta, and Coroth built on it's tributary, the river Coroth. During the Sarvaran golden age, Sarvara also controlled another, adjacent stretch of the river basin to the west.\n## History\nSarvara was founded by the Mora clan of the nomadic [Early Morellic Tribes](pre/early-morellic-tribes.md), who migrated into the Sarvaran river basin from the northeastern steppes. They mostly integrated into the native, sedentary cultures, most notably the [Diiran](lore/diira.md) minikin, from whom they gained the name for their holy river - the river Sarav[^1].\n\nFurther Reading: [Sarvaran History](private/trash/lore/sarvaran-history.md)\n## Sarvaran Logography\nThe Sarvaran Golden Age was precipitated by the invention of the Sarvaran Logography. The logography was written from top-to-bottom, carved either into wood or stone with bladed styli or chisels.\n\nThe logography resembled that of etruscan or nordic runes of the 0th Realm, and was initially used on wooden tablets for record keeping in trade, production, etc. Eventually, the Sarvaran Golden age saw it begin to be carved into other, similar materials, such as treetrunks, and only be used by nobles and priests.\n## Caste System\nThe sarvaran caste system was divided into 5 hereditary castes, derived from the early Morellic cultural structure, which then became reinforced by taboos and the organisation that came with the advent of the Bronze Age.\n### High-Matriarchs\nThe highest role in Sarvaran society was that of high-matriarchs, queen-like figures who ruled states. However, despite transcending the caste heirarchy, high matriarchs were not a caste in and of themselves, and were counted among the nobles.\n### Priests\nThe highest caste was the priests, who could be of any gender. This caste was derived from the spiritual leaders of the early Morellic tribes, and the duties of the priests were of celibacy, worship, and sacrifice. They led sermons in the temples, and were permitted to write oral tradition.\n### Nobles\nThe second highest caste was the nobles; this caste was earned through honor and age; almost all matriarchs and their husbands were nobles. The nobles often owned land and employed vassals, mostly other nobles and commoners, to live and work there. They commonly conducted accounting work and were permitted to write for this purpose.\n### Warriors\nThe third highest were the warriors. They descended from the early spiritual leaders as well as the priests, but rather focussed more on protection and sorcery rather than pastoral care and worship. They were often seen as dispensible and replaceable, and systemically mistreated, leading to their place in the heirarchy.\n### Commoners\nThe second lowest caste was the commoners. They were the laypeople and workers, vassals of the nobles, and made up the majority of the population in Sarvaran society. They were farmers, builders, smiths, and artists. Commoners were not permitted to write, but were capable of reading to a small extent, for religious purposes.\n### Wretched\nThe lowest caste was the wretched. These were the least in Sarvaran society, those with diseases such as leprosy, those who were dishonoured, and those who had commited social crimes such as treason. The wretched often lived outside of city walls, within primitive and basal communities.\n## Calendar\nThe date of the city's founding serves as year 0 of the Sarvaran calendar, which was one of the many innovations made by the Sarvaran Minikin. Other notable innovations included pottery, poetry, art, early mass-production, war, and cartography.\n## See Also:\n- [Sarvaran Architecture](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/sarvaran-architecture.md)\n- [Early Morellic Tribes](lore/2nd-realm/early-morellic-tribes.md)","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["sarvara","morellic","locations","civilisations"]},"/lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/sarvaran-architecture":{"title":"Sarvaran Architecture","content":"## Overview\nThe architecture of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) refers to the many styles and methods of building structures within the city state, and further settlements and outposts within its cultural sphere.\n\nIt was defined by intricate dwellings built in the trees or on the ground, with the main materials being [Dhajarh](flora/dhajar-trees.md) wood, bricks of stone taken from the mountains with bitumen used as mortar, fluvial clay, and Lunuth fabric.\n\nClassical Sarvaran architecture is found in the high-class structures of the Sarvaran golden age, and lived on in the neoclassical architecture of the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md) and the Corothic Republic.\n## Characteristics\n### Temples\nTemples were grand constructions in Sarvara, serving as the centrepieces of their respective districts and settlements. They were constructed out of many materials, including stone and wood, and were built on (sometimes artificial) mounds of earth.\n\nThe temples were circular or octagonal[^1] in shape, with one entrance leading in and out. The perimeter of the temples featured a hallway passing around the structure, which was accented by arched columns, and a plurality of watchstones carved into the walls.\n#### Main Area\nThe main area of the temples was paved with stone, with a raised platform in the centre; this is the altar where sacrifices would be performed by priests, rituals would be performed, and sermons would be given to the audience. The audience would collect in the surrounding area, kneeling or prostrating in reverence of the deities.\n#### Ablution Areas\nThe temples would also feature areas for ablution, where women could ddraw water from the ground with pumps built into the walls. This is where women would gather in the morning and evening to perform their ritual cleaning.\n#### Rooves\nThe circular main halls of Sarvaran temples were either open or enclosed, meaning that they either had or lacked a roof overtop. The perimetric halls would have a circular roof, tapering toward the inner wall which would continue upward with clerestory windows. There, the roof would cover the main hall in closed-roof temples.\n\nHowever, some temples were semi-enclosed, with their rooves replaced by dome-shaped windows, allowing intricate designs to be cast on the ground by the sun. Another form of semi-enclosed temple had smaller, concentric windows in the roof.\n### Monasteries and Barracks\nMonasteries and barracks were synonymous within Sarvaran culture, with both warriors and priests descending from the same early Morellic caste, the spiritual leaders.\n\nThese structures were similar to temples, only without a central area, and would feature kitchens and dormitories. The monasteries also featured many watchstones and small altar rooms, and the barracks would feature closed-eye watchstones, armories, and a large bronze gate through which the soldiers would march out.\n### Plazas and Markets\nSarvaran plazas often made their place in the centres of settlements or their districts. They were also found more frequently on tree platforms, and often featured benches and sitting areas as well as a large area to stand and walk; they also featured garden plots to augment the urban environment with foliage.\n\nThese plazas would serve as communal locations for trade, socialisation, protest, and for heralds to bring news to the people. Around and within these plazas could be found market stands, where goods could be traded for gold.\n\nThese market stands were commonly constructed out of wood, with a table, drawer to contain gold, and tiled rooves. They were often basal structures, but some were quite sophisticated, and some settlements even constructed stone market stands to incentivise trade.\n### Roads and Foundations\nSarvaran Minikin built roads and foundations out of gravel, sand, clay, and stone slabs. Roads featured gutters, through which water would be channeled, and enter irrigation channels, the ground, wells, catacombs, or sewers.\n#### Arboreal Pathways\nArboreal pathways were constructed out of clay, which was packed down onto the upside of large treebranches. These would be smoothed over, and had stairs carved into steep areas. These pathways would feature short railings made of carved stone, which would guide the minikin to stay on path; however, they could always realign themselves wth [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md).\n### Windows\nSarvaran buildings would feature unglazed windows with wooden grilles in place of glass; these grilles would be constructed out of Dhajarh wood, and carved into arabesque, intricate, patterns. Often, buildings would be aligned with the sun as to cast patterned shadows through the windows across the floor.\n### Rooves\nThe rooves of some Sarvaran buildings were sloped and made up of three layers; Lunuth straw, Lunuth fabric, and fluvial clay baked into tiles. The fabric and straw worked as insulation, and tiles allowed rainwater to flow down and over the structure.\n\nFurthermore, the corners of the rooves were notched, serving as gutters to channel water. This water would flow through gargoyles when it reached the rim of the roof, and watchstones would commonly be carved into them.\n\nDue to this, it was uncommon for gargoyles to be carved with their eyes closed, and this was only found around places of systemic inequality where those in power wished to be exempt from the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md)'s law.\n### Wooden Mansions\nWooden mansions, mainly built as treehouses, are a striking characteristic of Sarvaran architecture. They were commonly built around and tree trunks, specifically of Dhajarh trees, but could also be constructed on the ground.\n\nThey followed a polygonal, circular shape, and were constructed out of wood, with unglazed, patterned windows. Houses built on the ground often featured a surrounding pavement that led into the roads of the settlement.\n#### Treehouses\nTreehouses were wooden mansions built on the trunks of Dhajarh trees, within or just beneath the canopy. They were supported by large wooden supports jammed into the trunks, and set atop the foundation of wooden planks above these supports.\n\nThey would feature a trapdoor or hole by the trunk of the structure, sometimes with rope ladders dangling down, allowing Minikin to fly into the mansions from underneath.\n##### Tree Platforms\nAs treehouses were set atop foundations and supports, these platforms often appeared without buildings on top of them. These platforms were used for a variety of purposes, such as communal plazas, lookout spots, and markets.\n### Storage Shelters\nThe Sarvaran Minikin would also build storage shelters out of clay on treebranches. These shelters would commonly contain goods, such as Lunuth grain, fruit, berries, or materials like bronze, gold, diamonds, and Alucinarium.\n\nThey took the form of round compartments which dangled from the canopy, but could vary from high to low quality. They were sometimes given hinged wooden doors or fabric curtains.\n\nHigher-caste storage shelters were often carved with ornate patterns, similar to the aforesaid window grilles. They were also fitted with tiered, round bottoms, which tapered off into points, from which would be attached a small ornament or a banner which flew in the wind.\n### Huts\nSome structures were huts, which took on many forms. They were generally inhabited by the lower-caste individuals, and were less sophisticated than treehouses or temples. These huts could be built on the ground or in the trees, and were used as living areas, where the inhabitants would live, eat, and sleep.\n#### Kitchens\nWithin or outside these huts would often be built kitchen areas, with surfaces to prepare food, pantries or cabinets to store it, and stoves where fire could be kindled and channelled out of the top through an opening.\n##### Stoves\nThese stoves were small, partially-enclosed spaces, where fire would heat sheets of slate or pots placed above the opening, where food could then be cooked or boiled.\n#### Treehuts\nAn example is that of treehuts, which were built on ground-level within hollowed-out treetrunks. These huts would be fitted with primitive wooden doors and unsophisticated windows carved into the walls.\n\nThey would sometimes be partially sub-terranean, dug further into the ground to maximise space. In these cases, the floor may be slightly underground, or basements might be built-in with a wooden floor implemented at ground level.\n#### Mushroom Huts\nYet another example is mushroom huts. These were made of [Giant Morels](flora/giant-morels.md), a large, domesticated species of Morel that would grow, dry out into robust frames, and hollowed out into dwellings.\n\nThese huts would feature up to 3 storeys, with holes cut into the centre of each level, and a rope dangling through the centre to be climbed. They would similarly be fitted with primitive doors, with window-holes cut out of the mushroom's cap and filled in with circular window grilles.\n### Clay Huts\nSome huts were built out of clay, like storage shelters. They were either built on the ground, or as storage shelters, in the canopy. On the ground, they were round, wide, and conical, their walls tapering off into points to allow rainwater to flow off.\n\nIn the canopy, they were sometimes indistinguishable to storage shelters. However, they were often larger, padded with straw, wool, and were only used as places in which to sleep.\n### Toilets and Baths\nToilets and Baths were also an important building in Sarvaran culture. Most minikin would wash themselves and expel waste in nearby rivers, but the higher-caste individuals would do so in specially constructed buildings.\n\nThese buildings were similar to wooden mansions, only with stone pools in which to wash one's self, stations where towels and clothes were kept on shelves, and toilets that led into subterranean sewers.\n### Sewers\nThese sewers would connect the gutters, baths, and toilets within a settlement into an underground system of canals that would divert the flow of rivers to flush waste into the ground or back into river systems. They were built out of stone, as wood would rot.\n\n[^1]: 8 was a holy number to the Sarvaran minikin. Minikin have 8 fingers, and the Sarvaran language followed a base-8 system.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["lore","architecture","sarvara"]},"/lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/sarvaran-calendar":{"title":"Sarvaran Calendar","content":"## Overview\nThe Sarvaran calendar was the official calendar of the Sarvaran empire, and was used in most parts of the Sarvaran river basin during the empire's tenure in the Bronze age.

The civilisation began in the eponymous city-state of Sarvara, which would go on to flourish into one of the first, and most influencial, empires of the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).\n### Sarvara\nSarvara itself was a city, originally a city-state, and later the capital of the Sarvaran Empire. It was built in the Sarvaran River Basin upon the river Sarav, experiencing seasonal floods and greatly fertile soil. The city's main food sources were [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) wheat, [grubs](fauna/grubs.md), and [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md).\n\nThe city's name was partially calqued into Old Sarvaran from the Diiran term 'Kaula sa Laba,' meaning 'the city on the river.' This was rendered as '*Sarava-ran*,' and evolved into '*Sarvárą*.'\n## The Stone Age\nThe Stone Age was marked by the use of stone tools, hunter-gatherer tribalism, and basal magic use; customs such as pottery, writing, and complex technology were not put into practice yet. Thusly, Sarvara as it came to be did not exist during this period.\n\nThe area now known as Sarvara was then inhabited by the Diira minikin, a tribe that had settled from the west, and were related to the Neth minikin. The Diira were adept foragers, and were highly knowledgable of the edible and inedible foods of the river basin.\n\nThe northern steppes, across the Jana mountains from the basin, were then inhabited by the Mora minikin, a nomadic group. It was in the steppes that the Mora came into being, learning how to take advantage of the environment around them, especially of the native animals.\n### The Neolithic Period\nCirca. 10,200 BS[^1], the Neolithic period, or New Stone Age, was heralded by innovations such as the creation of structures, the domestication of animals, and the development of farming.\n#### The Pre-Pottery Neolithic\nThe pre-pottery neolithic period spanned from 10,200 BS to 5,700 BS, preceding the late neolithic. It was in this period that the Mora began to domesticate animals, taking on more of a pastoralist lifestyle rather than of hunter-gatherers.\n\nThe Diira further gained a foothold over their environment, beginning a tradition of proto-agriculture centred around seasonal harvests of the natural wilderness following the floods of the river Sarav. However, they had not mastered sowing, hybridisation, nor domestication of their local flora.\n#### The Late Neolithic\nThe Late Neolithic began circa 5,700 BS, marked by the emergence of pottery and developments in warfare, agriculture, and the building of structures.\n\nIt was in this time that the steppe was hit by droughts and famine, resulting in higher mortality rates and inter-tribal tensions. The Mora were now threatened by Nethic war parties from the west, who came east in search of water, food, and resources, and were driven out from their homeland.\n\nFollowing the Nethic raids, the Mora travelled south, passing through the Jana mountains, before arriving at the basin. There they came into conflict with the Diira, largely admixing into and wiping out the group, whilst appropriating aspects of their culture and their expertise on local flora and fauna.\n\nDuring this time, the Mora were greatly influenced by the Diira. Morellic women took Diiran husbands, and many words were loaned from the Diiran language, including the same of Sarvara.\n\nThe Mora were familiar with keeping [snoutgoats](fauna/snoutgoats.md) as livestock, but learnt to keep the native [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md) as livestock once they had settled. Furthermore, they began to cultivate and farm crops such as [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md), [Pelen](flora/pelen.md), and [Canara](flora/canara.md).\n## The Copper Age\nCirca 3,200 BS, the Mora had begun to mine and smelt ores such as copper and tin, spelling the end of the stone age and the beginning of the transitional chalcolithic period, or copper age.\n\nIt was in this period that the Mora began to smelt Janic copper in furnaces, greatly benefitted by the resources within Jana. The mountains afforded them resources such as flint, obsidian, and various other minerals and metals, which were all used in the creation of more sophisticated tools and weapons.\n## The Bronze Age\nThe bronze age was ushered in with the advent of agriculture, pottery, and, namely, bronze tools, circa 700 BS. \n\n[^1]: Before the founding of the city of Sarvara","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["lore","history","sarvara"]},"/lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/sarvaran-instruments":{"title":"Sarvaran Instruments","content":"## Overview\n[Sarvaran culture](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) was rich with artwork and innovation. The four most prominent fields in ancient Sarvara were pottery, poetry, architecture, and music. Music was an integral part of the culture, allowing all Minikin to express themselves through sound, in worship, in pain, and in love. Sarvaran music wouldn't exist without the culture's diverse range of instruments.\n## Sarvaran Tuning\nSarvaran tuning is made up of octaves of 8 tones. These tones generally follow pythagorean tuning, and are each named after the numbers. The first tone was roughly analogous to the note of A (44o Hz) in western tuning, although there was no standardisation in the time of the Sarvaran Civilisation until the advent of the [Empire Of The Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child).\n## Bakharra\nThe bakharra[^1] is a stringed instrument with 2 courses of doubled strings. The courses are commonly tuned a 5th apart (e.g. D and A), and each course is made up of two strings tuned an octave apart. It features a neck and head traditionally made of Dhajarh wood, tuning pegs made of ivory collected from wooly boars, a resonation chamber made of a gourd, and strings made of wooly hog intestines.\n\n![](images/bakharra_instrument.png)\n\nBakharranith are commonly used as background drones in Sarvaran music, occupying the mid-bass area of the pitch spectrum. Bakharra melodies are often the two courses being struck in alternation with one finger across the neck, but sometimes two fingers are used on each course, allowing the player to create more intricate melodies.\n\nThe Bakharra was commonly plucked in Sarvaran music, but in late Sarvaran culture, and especially in the following culture of the Empire of the Petrified Child, began to be bowed. \n### Bowed Bakharra\nThe Bowed Bakharra was played with a bow made of Dhajarh wood and Snoutgoat tail hair, known as a Djenna[^4]. It often appeared as part of an ensemble, and would go on to become a staple in Stonechild Imperial orchestral music.\n## Bakhalamu\nThe Bakhalamu[^5], part of the Bakharra family, is a similar stringed instrument. However, this instrument does not have courses and is made up of 3 strings, as shown in the instrument's meaning in the Sarvaran language.\n\nThe Bakhalamu was generally used as a treble instrument, to perform the main melody of a song or hymn overtop a backdrop of Bakharranith, Kuyudranith, and Danaikith.\n## Danaika\nThe Danaika[^2] is a wind instrument made traditionally of bone, or otherwise of Dhajarh wood, with 8 holes drilled on each side of its length, totalling 2 octaves in the Sarvaran tuning system. Danaikith commonly take the role of the lead or as part of an ensemble in Sarvaran music.\n## Kuyudra\nThe Kuyudra[^3] is a percussion instrument made of wooly hog skin that has been treated and stretched over a cylindrical or hemispherical wooden frame. These are placed inbetween the legs, in the lap, or between the feet of the player.\n\nKuyudranith are beaten in time to the accompanying instruments, providing a sense of rhythm, and feature in a genre of musical poetry where the drum alone accompanies a spoken-word vocalist, and is struck with each heavy syllable of the poem recited.\n\n[^1]: Sarvaran '*Bakharrą*' \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Bakha-azzan' meaning 'two (courses of) strings.'\n[^2]: Sarvaran '*Danaika*' \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Danu-âkâ' meaning 'bone flute.'\n[^3]: Sarvaran '*Küyudra*' \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Kuya-udza' meaning 'skin drum.'\n[^4]: Sarvaran '*Djenna*' \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Dyenna' meaning 'bow of an instrument.'

It was during this time that the majority of the language's poetic works, songs, and prose were composed.\n\nEventually, it developed into Vulgar Sarvaran, its more colloquial register. And after the Sarvaran Collapse, it developed during the Morellic Dark Ages into Stonechild Imperial. This language was spoken in the Empire of the Petrified Child, while Classical Sarvaran was kept as a liturgical, artistic language, by the time of the Morellic Renaissance Period.\n#### See Also:\n- [Proto-Morellic]\n- [Stonechild Imperial]\n- [Modern Morellic]\n## Examples\n\n## Phonology\n\n### Consonants\n| **Consonants** |                 | **Labial** | **Labiodental** | **Dental** | **Coronal** | **Palatal** | **Velar**  | **Uvular** |\n| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| **Nasals**     | **Plain**       | m          |                 |            | n           | ɲ \\\u003cny\u003e     | ŋ \\\u003cng\u003e    |            |\n| **Plosives**   | **Plain**       | p          |                 | t̪ \\\u003ct\u003e    |             | t͡ʃ \\\u003ctc\u003e   | \\[k] \\\u003ck\u003e  | q          |\n|                | **Voiced**      | b          |                 | d̪ \\\u003cd\u003e    |             | d͡ʒ \\\u003cdj\u003e   | g          |            |\n| **Fricatives** | **Plain**       | \\[ɸ] \\\u003cph\u003e | f               | \\[θ] \\\u003cth\u003e | s           | ʃ \\\u003cc\u003e      |            | χ \\\u003cqh\u003e    |\n|                | **Voiced**      | \\[β] \\\u003cbh\u003e | v               | ð \\\u003cdh\u003e    |             | ʒ \\\u003cj\u003e      | \\[ɣ] \\\u003cgh\u003e |            |\n| **Sonorants**  | **Plain**       | w          |                 |            | r           | j \\\u003cy\u003e      |            |            |\n|                | **Devoiced**    |            |                 |            | \\[r̥] \\\u003crh\u003e |             |            |            |\n| **Laterals**   | **Approximant** |            |                 |            | l           | ʎ \\\u003cll\u003e     |            |            |\n|                | **Fricative**   |            |                 |            | \\[ɬ] \\\u003clh\u003e  |             |            |            |\nThere are many allophonic rules in Sarvaran, owing to the language's historical forms and sound changes.

Sarvaran also lacks the definite article.\n### Pronouns\nIn sarvaran, pronouns almost never appear alone, they are always accompanied by a head, to which they depend or modify. They are attached onto adpositions, verbs, and possessed nouns.\n\n| **Pronouns**  | **Singular** | **Plural** | **No Number** |\n| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |\n| `1`           | san- / są-  | ey(a)-     |               |\n| `2`           | n(i)-        | ul-        |               |\n| `3` / `3.OTH` |              |            | m(u)-         |\n| `3.ANML`      |              |            | ell(a)-       |\n| `3.PLNT`      |              |            | yon- / yǫ-   |\n| `3.DEI`       |              |            | l(i)-         |\nPronouns feature 4 gender-like versions of the 3rd person pronoun, which lack number, unlike the 1st and 2nd person pronouns. The pronoun `3` (3rd person other) is mostly used for people and abstract concepts, but refers to anything within the 3rd person. The pronoun `3.ANML` refers to animals and animate natural processes, such as rivers or weather. The pronoun `3.PLNT` refers to plants and inanimate objects, such as buildings or geological formations. The pronoun `3.DEI` refers to deities and celestial beings, such as watchstones, the Angels, and the Judges.\n### Possession\nPossessive phrases in Sarvaran are achieved by attaching the pronominal prefix of the possessor onto the possessed noun and optionally including the possessor noun before the possessed.\n\nHeads do not include the pronominal agreement affix in the 3rd person singular other form. Only including it in situations where there is either no nominal subject, or to classify the dependent as referring to a concept previously mentioned.

They are known for their extinction due to rising sea levels.\n## Origins\nThe Thnayyan minikin originated from the Proto-Thnayyo-Nethic group of ancient hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the lands of southwest [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). The Thnayyans eventually migrated south to what is now the Aqhoran strait, and the Nethic minikin north to the equatorial lakes.\n## Achievements\nThe Thnayyans were among the first civilisations to prosper, mastering many art forms from pottery, to architecture, to agriculture, and to writing.\n### Thnayyan Script\nThe Thnayyan script was a logographic writing system which was chiselled into stone. The ruins of Thnayya are littered with stone-carved heiroglyphics, which many future historians would eventually try and fail to interpret.\n## Fall\nEventually, the knowledge, language, and wealth of Thnayyan was lost after a time of glacial melting that led the sea levels to rise, shortly before the Aqhorans migrated from the southwestern continent and the Sarvaran bronze age began.\n## Remnants\nThe remnants of Thnayya are found in Thnayyo-Nethic admixture into the genetics of Aqhor, the underwater ruins off the coast of the Sarvaran river basin, and both Aqhoran and Morellic folklore tracing back to Thnayyan culture.\n\nA rich culture of treasure hunting among Aqhoran seafarers eventually emerged as Thnayyan ruins began to be discovered, explored, and plundered for their artefacts, resources, and value.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["aqhor","thnayya","civilisations"]},"/lore/2nd-realm/tseireph":{"title":"Tseireph","content":"## Overview\nTseireph is a continent of the planet Kherell in the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).

It is often taken advantage of by living beings in order to manipulate the physical world in supernatural and otherwise unnachievable ways.\n## Appearance\nAlucinara energy itself is invisible, as it is not made up of matter, but rather metaphysical particles known as Alucinons. These alucinons can achieve physical form, however, when in high enough concentrations, manifesting as the crystalline element of Alucinarium (`Ac`).\n\nAlucinarium is an iridescent purple crystal with a bright orange lustre. It grows in long, razor-sharp, pyramidal shapes, which can be thin or wide. It is a very bristly crystal, breaking off easily into small chunks and dust. Alucinarium dust generally dissapears, but can have a longer lifespan in areas of high alucinon saturation.\n## Uses\nAlucinara is capable of doing many things. Its use can be unconscious, as in basal organisms and plants, or consciously used as in magic by sapient species. These uses range from allowing users to travel between [realms](lore/cosmology/the-realms.md), levitate objects and themselves, to cook food, to burn or freeze objects, and to commune with [spiritual beings](lore/cosmology/the-angels.md) as in prophecy and prayer; although this is not an exhausive list.\n## Sorcerers\nSorcerers are those who specialise in Alucinara use, and are capable of more difficult, high-complexity spells compared to laypeople and nonsapient animals, which may use Alucinara at a lower level of complexity, or simply as a biological process out of evolutionary instinct.\n## Consciousness\nAs Alucinara energy provides a bridge between the dreamscape and the corporeal realms, it has many consciousness-like effects. For example, when information is kept within the dreamscape, it can be stored and recalled on command.\n\nIt is for this reason that matter and energy can be seen to store and recall memory, resulting in the foundations for the existence of the [soul](lore/cosmology/darkness.md). Furthermore, it also results in the appearance of 'ghosts' when information is recalled and affects the physical world in apparitional ways.\n## See Also\n- [Darkness](lore/cosmology/darkness.md)","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["alucinara","cosmology"]},"/lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels":{"title":"The Angels","content":"## Overview\nThe Angels are celestial beings created by the [Judges](lore/cosmology/the-judges.md) to govern the different elements of the original creation, which reside in the dreamscape.

However, they and their devotees are unable to be punished by the deity due to its unwaivering respect and devotion to all things natural and spiritual. Thusly, many angels require evil acts of their devotees, and are known to some as demons.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["cosmology","deities","the-angels"]},"/lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges":{"title":"The Judges","content":"## Overview\nThe Judges were the two uncreated celestial beings who created the universe.

They would go on to perish upon the Shattering of the Realms, leaving behind an heir to protect the world they created, which was the [Petrified Child](images/the-petrified-child.png).\n\nWithin [Sarvaran](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) tradition, the Judges were the two moons of [Kherell](lore/2nd-realm/kherell.md), Ena and Udru.\n## The Shattering\nThe Shattering occurred after the second Judge rebelled against the first, secretly creating the energy of Alucinara, which allowed the concepts of time, consciousness, and life to exist. Living beings were originally contained within incorporeal spirits, which required to consume the cosmos to survive. Ultimately, the second Judge's rebellion was discovered by the first, when the living beings would attempt to consume the Judges after destroying the entirety of the original creation.\n\nThe living beings had fatally weakened the Judges, who then created the energy of [Darkness](lore/cosmology/darkness.md) to bind the living beings to physical forms, which would decay and perish in the course of time, and—with the waning remnants of their energy—created an heir in the form of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), to protect the natural world from the actions of living beings.\n\nUpon the Judges' death, their energy would release in an explosion known as the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang).

It was designed by the Judges to trigger the proliferation of the natural world, resulting in beautiful regions of ecosystemic prosperity known as Baby Meadows.\n\nHowever, baby sludge itself is highly dangerous before it is incorporated into nature. It highly fortifies all aspects of nature to achieve its goal (including decay, rot, pathogens, and bacteria), resulting in swift death through infection or necrosis to those who come in contact with it.\n## Appearance\nWithin the corporeal realms, the Petrified Child is bound within rock, as all beings with a [soul](lore/cosmology/darkness.md) require a body to exist within the physical realms.

In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain Alucinara and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.472499992Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna"]},"/phenomena/soulstone":{"title":"Soulstones","content":"## Overview\nSoulstones are deposits of bitumen or asphalt where, in the presence of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy, the soul of a deceased organism may be stored after death.\n## Appearance\nThe appearance of a Soulstone is that of a pebble or rock with a matte, rough, or shiny black surface.

Alucinarium is dusty, brittle, dark purple, and shines bright orange, emitting bright orange specks, orbs, and flashes of light when disturbed.\n## Origins\nAlucinara energy originates as the emminent energy that facilitated the first laws of nature, which were created by the first Judge. When the realms were shattered by the [spirits of darkness](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) and the first was destroyed, new emminent laws of nature were decreed by the second Judge to punish the spirits, but Alucinara was kept, and given physical form in the element of Alucinarium (as were the spirits given physical form in hydrocarbons).\n## Biology\nThe presence of Alucinara on living beings has many effects, such as; the development of the fortuitary gland, where Alucinarium is excreted into the bloodstream for use, and the manipulation of evolution in unexpected and fantastical ways.\n## Uses\nIt can be used to overcome the physical world through processes such as levitation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, hydrokinesis, energy medicine, and prophecy. It can also be used to contact deities through processes such as astral projection, dreams, and visions.\n### Examples\nSarqitwara fruit use Alucinara energy to emit bright flashes of light when disturbed as a biological process and defence mechanism when unripe. Similarly, Sapient species use Alucinara energy for many things, including to cook food and manipulate objects from afar.\n## Cultural Significance\nAlucinara is heavily culturally significant to virtually all cultures outside of the 0th realm, due to its fantastical and strange effects, especially how it can be used to contact incorporeal spirits.

Later Minikin groups settled down in arboreal cities, forming city states and, even later, nation states.\n### Diet\nMinikin are mostly herbivores, consuming fruits, nuts, leaves, vegetables, and treebark. Due to other forces, such as the development of cooking technology or food scarcity, Minikin also eat various forms of bread such as Lunuth bread, dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, and alcoholic drinks such as beer and fruit wine.\n## Bushdeer\n[Bushdeer](fauna/bushdeer.md) are a ruminant species native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They are related to Earth deer, with the major differences being their tree-like antlers, distinct white stripes on their sides, and skull-like white markings on their faces.\n### Diet\nBushdeer are herbivorous, their main source of food being leaves and moss. They sometimes eat other foods, such as algae, fungi, and small animals.\n### Antlers\nTheir antlers, their most striking feature, exhibit robust, vascularised, green pseudo-leaves; these leaves contain chloroplasts taken from the various photosynthetic organisms in the bushdeer's diets, and provide the animal with an extra source of energy.\n### Play-Dead Reflex\nWhen bushdeer undergo the instinctual play-dead reflex, the rib-like stripes and skull-like facial markings help to mask their bodies from predators, giving the impression that they have already been fully scavenged and begun to rot.\n## Pygmy Bushdeer\nPygmy bushdeer are a part-arboreal, smaller version of common bushdeer. They are venerated by the Morellic minikin as sacred animals, and are thus forbidden to be killed in Morellic culture.\n### Use\nThey are used as mounts by some Minikin cultures, including the Morellic, who ride them during religious ceremonies and pilgrimages. Other nomadic cultures ride them to find new areas for their livestock to graze.\n## Wooly Hogs\n[Wooly hogs](fauna/wooly-hogs.md) are a species native to the 2nd realm which are related to, and resemble, the wild boars of earth. They are small and farmed for their wool and pork.\n### Appearance\nThey are about 25 cm in height when mature, but are proportionately bulky. They feature a large, long head, humped shoulders, small hind end, short legs, and characteristic long, curly fur.\n### Use\nThey are farmed by some Minikin cultures for their robust wool and nutricious pork, and are sometimes ridden or yoked. In order to remove parasites from their flesh, they are cooked, and it is considered taboo to eat their pork raw.\n\nAmong Morellic hunter minikin, it is said that it is good luck to cleanly cut a wild Wooly Hog's tail off, and bad luck to fail to do this. These tails are often kept as trophies by hunters, and appear in heraldry as a symbol of good skill.\n## Dragons\n[Dragons](fauna/dragons.md) are a small amphibious species native to the 2nd, 3rd, and -2nd realms.

They are half a metre tall, with fur that ranges from light beige to brown.\n\nSome Minikin groups farm or hunt Snoutgoats, utilising their meat, milk, fur, sinew, and dung for food, dairy, clothing, tools, and fuel. Some groups mount snoutgoats, riding them for transport.\n## Rat Monkeys\n[Rat monkeys](fauna/Treemice.md) are an arboreal monkey species native to the 2nd and -1st realms, the only monkey species native to Tséireph below the equatorial rainforest.

They are herbivores and browsers, consuming leaves and moss. The most striking difference is their antlers, which feature 'leaves.'\n## Origins\nAt first, the descendents of Sika deer which had undergone essential shift began to experience swift evolution due to the effects of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) on their bodies. One of these changes was the development of folate, vascularised protrusions on their antlers.\n\nThese 'leaves' initially served as areas for heat exchange in the steppes. However, due to the increased consumption of photosynthetic organisms aided by the new ecosystem they had found themselves in, these 'leaves' began to also serve as dumps for chlorophytes, which the deer couldn't metabolise.\n## Appearance\nBushdeer appear brown, white, and black. Their leaves can vary from green to yellow to pink depending on their diets. Their sides are painted with long, white, vertical streaks, reselving ribs, and their tops feature dappled white spots.\n## Behaviour\nWhen under threat, they undergo the reflex to go limp and play dead. This is aided by their ribcage-esque fur patterns, which make them appear to be rotting and already scavenged.\n## Cultural Significance\nThe arboreal bushdeer (spp. *Floricervus arborealis*), a dwarfish relative to the common bushdeer native to the forests of Tséireph, is seen as sacred by the Morellic minikin, who collect their antlers when they are dropped. These antlers are generally put on display or ground into a powder for medicinal purposes.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["fauna","deer"]},"/private/trash/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDemi-Slugs (spp. *Arion homunculus*) are a nomadic sapient gastropod species native to the 1st realm. They are herbivores, eating leaves and soft plant tissue. They live in societies built around the ceremonial and survivalistic foraging of plants and defense from other animals.\n\n## Adaptations\nAfter the Supernova of 80MB, a great portion of slugs were shifted into the 1st realm. These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with Alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [Alucinarium](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to Alucinarium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["fauna","people"]},"/private/trash/fauna/direwolves":{"title":"Direwolves","content":"## Overview\nDirewolves are a group of carnivorous, predatory canines native to the infra-essent realms.

The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same Alucinara that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Morellic Race\n\n### Austerkin Race\nThe Austerkin are a lot hairier compared to other minikin races.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution can vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tends to have hair, and the tail is fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin are almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin are hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour can vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour can vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [Alucinarium](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tend to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's den(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or dens.\n\nModern minikin groups inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees are often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commits a crime, they are ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails are seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and disconnection from the soul is representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' can vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group is too large for one community, it inevitably collapses. A varying amount of groups form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups are often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of Alucinarium secretion and essential shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, are greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernate in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin become unconscious in a sleep-like state, and Alucinarium levels in the brain increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protect the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis is not seen in normal sleep, but is shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of Alucinarium in the brain during hibernation is a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["fauna","people"]},"/private/trash/fauna/treewolves":{"title":"Treewolves","content":"## Overview\nTreewolves are a species of carnivorous canine native to the -1st and [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) realms. They are related to [direwolves](private/trash/fauna/direwolves.md), but are smaller, more primate-like, and live a primarily arboreal lifestyle. They are native to the deepest areas of the forests and jungles of their respective realms.\n## Appearance\nTree-wolves can reach a length of about 45cm from the base of the tail to the tip of the snout at maturity. They are covered with a warm coat of dark fur with light spots. Their paws are more hand-like, and their limbs stronger, allowing them to better traverse the canopy and manipulate objects, and have sharp nails.\n## Behaviour\nTreewolves are largely solitary, crepuscular hunters, emerging in the twilight to find prey. They stalk the canopy, jumping down on their unfortunate victims. Furthermore, they utilise [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to warp light around them, appearing either invisible or warped to appear as another animal or being. They have small litters of 1 to 2 children, which they protect until maturity, when they leave to hunt alone.\n## Diet\nTreewolves are carnivores, consuming a similar diet to their relatives, the direwolves. However, due to their overlapping distributions, they are much more likely to consume [minikin](fauna/minikin.md).

The groups which would grow to become the largest and most influencial were the nomadic Morellic minikin and sea-faring Aqhoran minikin.\n## Early Bronze Age\nThe Early Bronze Age was triggered by the dawn of agriculture, which was developed by the Sarvarans and Aqhorans in Tseireph. Due to this, many agricultural settlements and farms were founded, such as the initial settlements of Sarvara, Coroth, and Aqhor.\n\nIn tandem with the developments in agriculture, magic (the use of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) energy) was also developed and innovated. Sorcery became a complex art form that aided the Minikin in breaking through frontiers in food, building, and warfare.\n\nFor example, without the capability of pyrokinesis, Minikin were too small and feeble to create Fire unaided. But with the help of magic, the Minikin were capable of cooking their food, boiling water, and baking wheat into bread.\n## Middle Bronze Age\nIn the middle of the bronze age, these powers had grown to a greater size. The city state of Sarvara had grown to be the largest settlement in souther Tseireph, let alone the whole continent, Aqhor had grown into a formidable naval force centred in Aqhor, and Coroth had continued as a pastoral nomadic group, living in urban diasporas alongside other cultures or alone in rural villages.\n\nIt was in this period that Sarvara was seeing the beginning of the golden age, a time where Sarvaran civilisation had reached the point that not all people were required to work in farms or temples; accounting gained greater importance, warfare became more refined and efficient, religious idols and pottery reached greater levels of complexity and refinement, and artwork such as decorative textiles, visual art, idols, prose, and poetry began to be created.\n\nThe Sarvaran Golden Age set an example in southern Tseireph, and completely transformed the level of achievement in the surrounding cultures. Aqhor was the most affected, sharing in many innovations, although to a lesser extent. Coroth was least affected, sticking to their nomadic pastoralist lifestyle, but still gained importance in middle Bronze Age society for their role in farming and exporting goods.\n## Late Bronze Age\nThe late Bronze Age saw these great civilisations fall; as they grew larger and more ambitious, the door to pathogens and plague was opened. The urban environments, such as in Sarvara or Aqhor, were affected the most dearly, and were devestated, unnable to return to the heights they had reached in the Sarvaran Golden Age.\n\nIn this era, the Aqhorans largely migrated back to their homeland in the southwest across the Aqhoran Channel, whereas some stayed behind and moved to the countryside, these became known as the the 'Oyholiru' minikin. Most Sarvarans, however, stayed in the urban environments out of pride and died, leaving the capital a ghost town. The rest of the Sarvarans and the Corothic minikin left for the rural Corothic villages.\n\nIt was in this time that Coroth saw it's greatest period of development. Taught by the Sarvaran Refugees, Coroth was able to reach a level comparable to Sarvara at its height by the end of the late Bronze Age. And due to the native fauna of the continental climate, Coroth was able to use its native flora to create medicines that the Sarvarans didn't have access to. And ultimately, the plague was ended.\n## Further Reading\n- [Iron Age History](lore/2nd-realm/iron-age-history.md)","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["lore","history","2nd-realm"]},"/private/trash/lore/sarvaran-history":{"title":"Sarvaran History","content":"## Overview\nAncient Sarvara was a civilisation of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) which was founded by the [early Morellic tribes](lore/2nd-realm/early-morellic-tribes.md) and spanned from the late neolithic era to the end of the Bronze age. The civilisation was centred in the city of Sarvara, which began as a city state built on the river Sarav and flourished into an empire which proved to have great influence on the region contemporarily and for millenia to come.\n## The Neolithic Period\nSarvara wasn't concieved until the latter part of the neolithic period, or stone age. In the early to mid neolithic period, the region surrounding the river Sarav was travelled through, settled, abandoned, and forgotten innumerable times by various [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) groups.\n### The Diiran Minikin\nIt wasn't until the [Diiran](lore/diira) minikin migrated from the west and settled the area that it gained permanent residence. The Diiran hunter-gatherers got to work building simple houses, creating pottery, and hunting in the region.[^1]\n\nWhile the Diira had not innovated into agriculture, they survived off of the natural flora and fauna of the land, including berries, small mammals, fruit, nuts, insects, leaves, and bark. But their main food source was fish; the yield was so plentiful that the group was able to sustain itself purely off of the Sarav.\n### The Mora Minikin\nThe Mora minikin hadn't yet migrated south into the Sarvaran river basin, but they would serve the most influence genetically and culturally on Sarvaran society. In the neolithic period, the Mora were nomadic pastoralists living in the steppes to the north of the Sanya mountains, who herded animals such as [snoutgoats](fauna/snoutgoats.md) and [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md).\n\nEventually, the early Morellic tribes were driven out of the steppes due to famine. The steppe was undergoing desertification and soil fertility was poor; and on top of the threat of starvation, the desert-dwelling peoples of the north were pillaging, thieving, and travelling in war parties to survive.\n\nThe Mora and other Morellic tribes migrated mainly south to the mediterranean-climate Sarvaran River Basin, spreading their territory throughout the lands they came through, although some groups travelled southwest. The Sanya mountains served as a great source of resources, especially copper and flint, which were used in the creation of tools and weapons such as darts.\n## The Bronze Age\nThe bronze age came as the Mora settled down by the river Sarav and had begun to master the process of Agriculture. Not only was the soil in the basin rich and ferile, but the river also experienced predictable floods, meaning that farmers could plant their crops in anticipation. But ultimately, the migration wasn't clean, and there were many battles between the Mora and the Diira until the two found the confidence to coexist.\n### The 1st Sarvaran Dynasty\nThe 1st Sarvaran Dynasty was founded by High Matriarch Coriandra I. It was Coriandra's guidance that aided the Mora in battle, and allowed them to squash the spirit of dissent amongst the Diirans during the Coriandran wars. Her tactical decisions governed the placement of new settlements, outposts, forts, and battlefields.\n\nIt wasn't until her daughter, Coriandra II, came into power that the wars subsided and diplomacy gained greater importance. Intermarriage was encouraged, not only for political reasons among the nobles, but also for genetic homogeneity among the commoners.\n\nIt was the Diirans that taught the Mora how to hunt and fish the local fauna effectively, and it was the Mora to teach the Diirans the art of animal husbandry with the livestock they brought. But the local flora was very easy to farm, and it didn't take long for both groups to begin planting [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) wheat, [Pelen](flora/pelen.md) root, and orchards worth of [Sarkitwara](flora/sarkitwara.md) trees and [Nyutabushes](flora/nyutabushes.md) together.\n#### Aqhor\nAnother nation to emerge was [Aqhor](lore/aqhor.md), which was made up of seafarers from the southwestern continent. The city of Aqhor was built upon the delta of the river Sarav, and the nation controlled the lands surrounding the mouth of the river and the coastline.\n\nAqhor proved to be a beneficial trade partner to Sarvara, and the two entered a trade partnership that would last through to the end of the 1st dynasty. Aqhor mainly exported sweetrice, a rice plant brought over from the southwest that could only grow in the wetlands of the delta.\n#### Coroth\nCoroth was another nation, a Morellic nation that had migrated southeast to the continental forests. Coroth was less of a salient trade partner at this time, but their exports of blue dye and various textiles gained them great wealth during the Sarvaran Golden Age.\n### The Founding of Sarvara and the Early Period\nIt was during the 1st dynasty that Sarvara was well and truly founded, marking the beginning of the Early Sarvaran Era. On a hill in a wooded area by the river Sarav, the city was founded on a small fishing settlement, chosen not only for its strategic geography but also for the surrounding lowlands, which were turned into farms, and the optimal location for fishing.\n\nDuring Coriandra I's lifetime, the Temple of the High Matriarch was constructed on the peak of matriarch's hill, in what would become the royal district. It was here that the High Matriarch and the other members of her dynasty were to live, and the matriarch's nobles in the surrounding areas.\n### The Middle Sarvaran Era\nEventually, all cultural and genetic distinctions between Diira and Mora were eroded into the singular ethnicity of 'Sarvaran,' and the territory of Sarvara expanded beyond the borders of the city state. And as agriculture was mastered by the Middle Sarvaran Era, various other innovations needed to be made.\n\nWith the growing complexity of trade, accounting became more important, and thus writing emerged in the form of the Elder Sarvaran Logography, a script which was etched into leaves with a sharp stylus and inked with dark natural pigments or dirt.\n\nAnd as the Sarvarans were left with less labour to complete, time was left for the civilisation to develop its rich culture of religion and artwork. It was in this period that the mythic oral traditions of Sarvara were embellished to the point of fiction, and Coriandra I was mythologised into a legendary figure.\n\nFurthermore, pottery began to be seen not only as a means for storage and cleanliness but also as an art form in and of itself. Clay from the banks of the Sarav was sought by many groups and sold for a lot of money for its high quality, and became a staple of Sarvaran pottery from then until eternity.\n\nThe military of Sarvara was greatly developed in this era as well. The greatest minds of Sarvara were recruited to devise new methods of warfare, new weapons, and new spells for the military, which went on to win so many battles that Sarvara began to be a feared adversary to its enemies.\n### The Sarvaran Golden Age\nBy the Sarvaran Golden Age, also known as the Classical Sarvaran Era, the language of Sarvara was standardised into Classical Sarvaran, and the Middle Sarvaran Logography had developed into the Classical Sarvaran Script, an abjad etched into leaves and also carved into wood. The oral tradition was now codified into scripture, and read out reverently in the temples.\n\nThe golden age was a period of great cultural, technological, and religious development. It was in this time that the Sarvaran civilisation reached its peak, and it wouldn't be until the Empire of the Petrified Child that society would reach and surpass such development.\n\nThe Sarvaran Golden Age saw the emergence of poetry as an art form, and many many poets lived, left their mark, and died; their poems would be read about fires, their songs sung in the temples, and their spells recited and cast for centuries to come. Sarvaran poetry was distinct for its unique metrical structure, influenced by the polysynthetic grammar of the language.\n\nFurthermore, the golden age was marked by a distinct lack of conflict. The civilisation was greatly pacifistic in worship of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), and surrounding nations didn't see the use in warring with such a great trade partner and military power.\n### The Late Sarvaran Era\nThe Late Sarvaran Era began with the end of the Sarvaran Golden Age and the emergence of the Great Plague. The plague decimated Sarvaran civilisation, spelling the end of the 1st dynasty. It was High Matriarch Fennel III, a noble, who took leadership over Sarvara as the first high matriarch of the 2nd dynasty after the 1st dynastic family line had all but perished.\n\nIt was in this period that the Fennellic wars began. These were a series of battles began not only between Sarvaran nobles vying for power, but also between the nations of the river basin. For example, Aqhor, rather than seeing Sarvara as a trade partner, joined in the battle against the 2nd dynasty in search of wealth, resources, slaves, and power.\n\nSarvara was greatly weakened, and the urban environments were all but abandoned - the city of Sarvara was lost. Furthermore, Classical Sarvaran was no longer spoken; rather, a rural dialect gained prestige after Fennel fled to the countryside and her dynasty based itself in her family villa.\n### The Lost Era\nThe Lost Era was defined by the fall of the city of Sarvara. It was in this time that the 2nd dynasty struggled to stay afloat, but protected its disparate rural territories with fervent vigor, leading to such settlements gaining a foothold in the wake of the Great Plague.\n\nIn this period the nation of [Coroth](lore/coroth.md) gained greater importance, supporting the remnants of Sarvara out of a sense of sisterhood. The two formed a political, military, and trade relationship.\n\nEventually, the 2nd dynasty culminated in the last battle of the Fennellic wars between Sarvara and Aqhor. The battle ended with the death of the last high matriarch of the 2nd dynasty, High Matriarch Saffron II. From here, the great Corothic general known as Elephant I was elected High Patriarch (the first Patriarch in Sarvarn history) by the Sarvaran nobles, spelling the beginning of the the Empire of the Petrified Child and the 1st Stonechild Dynasty.\n## The Iron Age\nThe iron age began as minikin began to collect iron in mines and use it in tools. It was Coroth that had begun learning how to smelt the metal down, and they brought this knowledge with them as they entered the Sarvaran River Basin and grew in power under the banner of the Empire of the Petrified Child\n### The Founding of the Empire of the Petrified Child\nThe Empire of the Petrified Child was founded by High Patriarch Elephant I, and was headquartered in the northern settlement of Nayura.\n## Further Reading\n- [The History of the Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/the-empire-of-the-petrified-child/stonechild-history.md)\n\n[^1]: It was from Old Diiran that the name of the river and city name emerged, '*Káula sa-Lába*' meaning 'the town at the river.'

These were the first things little Blueberry saw when he woke up. This environment he had found himself in seemed like a poor imitation of what he was used to, which was a constant supply of cucumber and the fibreglass tree stump he called home - but this wasn't his home, this was something else.\n\nAs Blueberry got up, the first thing he noticed other than the lice, dirt, and leaves was a small raspberry which almost felt like a relief to see as it was Blueberry's favourite food, with a note next to it written in some other language he didn't know.\n\nSlowly enjoying his raspberry, Blueberry started to realise his predicament. This was not a dream as he had first thought, but is a serious situation - one which he didn't have a full grasp of. Having finished his final bite of the berry, Blueberry walked onward in an attempt to figure out where he was, or why he had even been abandoned from his old life, sleeping inside the fibreglass tree stump, which itself was inside a glass terrarium of sorts.\n\nTrawling along a path, which was cloaked by an interconnected net of brambles and leaves, Blueberry began to get emotional, sitting atop a pebble, quietly sobbing to himself. He missed his tree-stump, he missed his cucumber. Knowing that he doesn't know his way home, the little guy looked around, sobbing harder than before, and that was when he saw a sparkle come from the heavens.\n\nNot trusting his eyes, Blueberry blinked rubbed his tears away, and noticed it again - it was unmistakably a sprinkle of iridescent dust coming from above. Having stopped crying, Blueberry asked who was there, his voice hoarse.\n\n\"Haha,\" a small but mellifluous voice called out, \"It's, uh, me.\"  \nBlueberry was quite confused, not having heard a voice of such quality before. \"And who might you be?\" he responded, his eyebrow raised.  \n\"I am the stool under which the toad sits, the shoe in which which the lady lives.\" The voice cryptically rang out.  \n\"So... your name is Toadstool?\" Blueberry asked inquisitively.  \n\"I am the sun and the moon, the-\" The voice was cut off by Blueberry, who grumpily called out \"Cut the nonsense, Lad.\"  \n\"Well if you're gonna act like that... Alright. My name might as well be Toadstool.\" It said, slowly fluttering down to reveal its appearance.\n\nToadstool seemed to be a fairy, adorned with pastel blue hair and green clothes with flowers tucked in each pocket. \"I'm a fairy.\" Toadstool proclaimed, his hair fluttering against his pointy ears. Dumbstruck by the fairy's appearance, Blueberry stammered as he replied. \"I... am Blueberry.\" He said, holding his hand out introductorily.\n\nShaking Blueberry's hand gleefully, Toadstool smiled and replied. \"Booberry... huh. Strange name.\" Having misheard Blueberry. \"No-\" Blueberry tried to reply, cut off by Toadstool's hasty attempts to drag him deeper into where they were.\n\n\"Come on Booberry, if you're here in the wild ya gotta know you way around!\" Toadstool gleefully said, grabbing Blueberry's hand and dragging him off to someplace new. Blueberry, startled by being dragged from his rocky perch, noticed that Toadstool's hand was covered in the same iridescent dust that he has seen earlier when Toadstool was above him.\n\nBlueberry didn't expect Toadstool's hand to feel as comfortable as it did, but that may have been because the both of them were flying. As they drifted through the air, Blueberry started to find it hard to focus on the sadness of being away from his home and, surprisingly, he was okay with that. The only thing on his mind was that he was flying.\n\nBlueberry had never flown before, on account of the fact that he was particularly slimy and sluggish, so this experience was very new to him and he didn't know what to make of it other than the feelings he already knew, such as touch, smell, and sight. Although he had a hard time understanding what was in front of him, he still tried to keep a smile on his face as he looked at Toadstool.\n\n\"Cool Scenery, huh?\" Toadstool said, looking onward.  \n\"Scenery? All I've known is my home.\" Blueberry responded, reflecting on his old tree stump.  \n\"Um... Do you not know what scenery is...?\" Toadstool uttered incredulously.  \nBlueberry tried to answer, his forefinger outstretched, but found that he couldn't muster a response. After a moment of silence only broken by the wind rushing past them, Blueberry managed to reply; \"I can't truthfully describe what I'm seeing right now.\"\n\n\"Really? You don't know what a pond is? Or a tree?\" Toadstool said after a pause saturated with thoughts.  \n\"I know what water is, or what leaf is. Just not a pond, nor a tree; a tree stump, however...\" Blueberry replied, thinking about the features of his life.  \n\"Well, a pond is a big collection of water. Y'know, the clear stuff, and leaves grow on trees which're big planty structures.\" Toadstool replied. Blueberry didn't, as he had nothing much to say, but this was quickly alleviated by Toadstool shouting out loud - \"Hey, we're almost above Morelland!\"  \nAlmost startled by Toadstool's outburst, Blueberry quickly responded with \"Uh... Where?\"  \n\"Uh, there!\" Toadstool replied, pointing to a colony of mushrooms next to a pond.  \nBlueberry knew what mushrooms were, as they were a rare but delightful foodstuff he'd be given at times, but he didn't think they would be deserving of the title, \"-Land.\"  \n\"Those little things? You're making me hungry, man.\" He said, as he and Toadstool veered to the left and downward, nearing the area.\n\nAs Blueberry and Toadstool landed, Blueberry recoiled at the fairy's fluttering wings as they came to a stop. With both their feet on the ground, Blueberry let go of Toadstool's hand, revealing that he had been given his own fair share of iridescent dust from Toadstool's hand, which he quickly brushed off against a clump of green moss.\n\n\"This is Morland...?\" Blueberry asked, mispronouncing the name since he was unimpressed with the lack of infrastructure.  \n\"No, have you ever been out in the wild befo... oh yeah, you haven't!\" Toadstool hastily replied, only halfway through realising that yes - his newfound acquaintance hadn't been out in the wild, (of course, except for his enclosure.)  \n\"It seems you've more experience than I'd have thought, though; you've already opened an Ālūcinārī Gateway.\" He added, noting the flowing spiral emitting a full array of colours behind Blueberry. Blueberry jumped as he noticed it, surprised by the glowing whirl of hues which was coming from the moss.\n\n\"I wouldn't put it past you to jump, but it was you who did conjure it.\" Toadstool mentioned, patting Blueberry on the back.  \n\"I didn't make it - I... I just brushed the dust on my hand against some moss.\" Blueberry responded, visibly disturbed by the sight.  \n\"Not the first time I've seen someone get so perturbed by an Ālū' Gateway, I'm gonna need to to listen to me close if you wanna see the entirety of Morelland.\" Toadstool said, looking Blueberry straight in the eyes as he took a small pouch out of one of his many pockets.\n\n\"Gateways can be an extremely difficult thing to get through, but eventually, everyone gets through.\" He added, wrapping a small blue velvet cloth he took from the pouch around his arm. \"Grab onto my arm, and just follow my lead.\"\n\nThe two of them stepped in, Blueberry meekly hiding behind Toadstool. As the spiral engulfed them, Blueberry couldn't help but feel the immense forces upon him as he felt his essence float around like a butterfly - leaving his body and re-entering like a sheepish firefly. Round and round and round the two of them went within the Ālūcinārī Gateway, and as the transportation reached it's zenith, Blueberry found it hard to stay conscious, and eventually, scared he may let go of Toadstool, fainted.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["writing","draft","if only"]},"/writing/drafts/draft-2":{"title":"If Only (Draft 2, 17 Oct 2023)","content":"## Chapter 1\n\nPeople are made for one another, to live and love in the company of those they care about.

He wasn’t awake, but he was alive, his breath shallowly flaring into cold mist.\n\nHis eyes fluttered up as the sun came out from below the horizon, bathing the forest in golden sunlight that washed his body with light enough to wake all things this side of the world. His body weakly buckled as he got up, beginning to thirstily trudge onward. He needed help.\n\nSome people need love, some need riches, but what he needed most was water. A fire, a home, a lover, all of this was irrelevant in the wake of the instinctual drive to survive that came over him like a wild animal.\n\nHis need was satisfied in part when he found a cluster of berries hidden amongst leaf-litter. He felt vitality return as he ate.\n\n‘Enjoying those?’ A voice called out. The man jumped, looking around, but there was nobody there.\n\n‘You think you can eat anything you find out here? Food is scarce. And judging by how you look, it seems you aren’t used to how this place works.’ The voice added.\n\n‘What is this place?’ The man timidly responded.\n\n‘You think I know? I just know things live here. Big, ugly people. And beasts. If we’re not safe, we could get eaten.’\n\n‘What are you doing here then?\n\n‘What are You doing here?’ It said, deflecting the inquiry.\n\nThe man paused. ‘Where are you anyway?’\n\n‘Up.’ The voice quickly increased in volume as the word progressed. In a thud and a puff of leaves, the voice fell to the ground, coalescing into a figure as it now stood before the man.\n\n‘What are you?’ The man exclaimed.\n\n‘Toad Stool, son of Toad Petal, from Amanitaville.’ The figure declared. ‘You can call me Toadstool.’\n\n‘No, What are you?’\n\n‘Thought this might be a problem. I am a Minikin.’\n\nThe man stared at Toadstool as if he were inspecting a newborn. He had a bushy tail, but was hairless apart from it and a head of dark-green hair. His face was elongated into a whiskered snout and a large, wide nose, and his eyes differed to the man’s. The man’s eyes sat upon stalks, but Toadstool’s sat inside the sides of his face. His skin was also smooth.\n\n‘Now, I know What you are, a Slugfolk, but I don’t know who you are.’ Toadstool declared.\n\n‘I’m Aanurku jau Nghwaluu, son of Siiranlat jat Nghwaalut.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘That’s my name.’\n\n‘I’ll just call you Blueberry.’ Toadstool conceded, pointing at what Blueberry had just eaten. ‘That’s what you get for eating my lunch. And where are you from?’\n\n‘From…’\n\nThe forest silently awaited the conclusion to his response. Despite the patience of the trees, the birds chirped stubbornly alongside the distant, echoing drone of habitation.\n\n‘Can you just get me out of here?’ Blueberry said; a response never came. ‘I need to find a place to live.’\n\n‘It doesn’t matter. I know you’re from the place other Slugfolk are from, although I’ve never been. But yes, I’m better than other people out here–I’ll let you in. Follow me.’\n\nBlueberry sighed cathartically when he heard this, beginning to follow Toadstool as he walked through the greenery. Blueberry looked around, taking in the environment. It was all new to him. He couldn't keep his eyes from the trinkets that dangled from Toadstool's bag.\n\n‘So, what’s that?’ Blueberry asked, making conversation. ‘That golden ring on your back.’\n\n‘An ornament.’\n\n‘What do you have it for?\n\n‘Décor.’\n\n‘And that chain, those coins rattling around inside of your rucksack?’\n\n‘...’\n\n‘Why are you dodging the question?’\n\nToadstool turned around to face Blueberry. ‘None of your business. Just follow me, ask no questions, not until we’re under some shelter.’\n\nBlueberry paused for a second as Toadstool took the initiative to turn forward once more. He stared at his back inquisitively.\n\nThe two walked through a thicket, coming upon a tunnel into the ground. It had been dug years ago, judging by the way the dirt had been packed over time, and was only just small enough for the two to pass through–a rabbit couldn’t even get inside without much struggle. The sunlight began to dim as they advanced further and deeper into the seemingly endless tunnel, which eventually widened.\n\nThe light began to grow once more. Happening upon a room, Blueberry was relieved to be in a place he could rest. There were straw beds elevated on the ground with which to sleep and a few wooden boards wedged into the earthen walls, all of which were adorned with candles which lit up the room in orange.\n\nToadstool pulled a rock over the entrance, setting his rucksack atop one of the boards, and sat on the edge of one of the beds.\n\n‘So.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘What’s your story?’\n\n‘Well. You know I’m a “Slugfolk.” What else is there to say?’\n\n‘Come on. There’s more to you than your species, right?’\n\n‘I, uh…’ Blueberry mumbled, stuttering. ‘Tell me why I should trust you first.’\n\n‘Because I’m in control. Look at you–you’re wearing rags, your weak spot isn’t even covered… I saw you laying there in the brush; one well placed spear through your pneumostome and that would be it.’\n\n‘Is that a threat?’\n\n‘No, no… I’m just saying. I’m not the best guy, but I’m nice enough to help you out. Wronging you is unnecessary.’\n\n‘But you didn’t answer my question.’ Toadstool added. ‘Something must have happened to get you here; tell me–why aren’t you off in some steppe from another world eating bark and salad?’\n\n‘I don’t remember what caused it.’ Blueberry admitted. ‘But I did something. Because of it, my people began to hate me, and after a grassroots trial, they managed to force me out of my hometown.’ He laughed retrospectively. ‘In the end, I don’t even remember how or why, I woke up here once it was over.’\n\n‘Not going to tell me what you did to make them hate you?’ Toadstool asked. ‘But that’s fine, everybody has their secrets.’\n\n‘So what’s yours?’ Blueberry inquired.\n\n‘Hm?’\n\n‘Your story.’\n\nToadstool stared at the wall behind Blueberry. ‘I’m not someone to look up to. End-of.’\n\n‘I’m not asking for your sins. Just, where are you from? What’s your background?’\n\n‘Oh.’ He paused. ‘You know I’m from Amanitaville, like my name says. I have …8… brothers and sisters. I’m from the Clan of the Deer. I sell things.’\n\n‘Like a merchant?’\n\n‘Yes, you could say so. A merchant.’ Toadstool seemed happy with this conclusion. ‘I have family in Amanitaville; I could let you sleep in one of our shelters.’\n\n‘That’s so kind of you!’ Blueberry exclaimed. ‘Thank you… but tell me… Are there people like me in Amanitaville?’\n\n‘Slugfolk?’\n\n‘Yep.’\n\n‘There’s people there. I… don’t actually spend that much time there, I couldn’t say. But–by the sacred will of the Petrified Child–you’ll fit in. Probably.’\n\n‘Petrified what now?’\n\n‘It’s just an old saying. An old god.’\n\nBlueberry shuffled in his seat uncomfortably. The truth set in; he was abandoned, alone, in a world of new gods, new species, and new worlds. He wondered if he would never be able to get used to the world outside of his hometown. He tried to take his mind off of it.\n\n‘So, why did you bring me here, closed off underground?’ Blueberry asked. ‘Because clearly this isn’t Amanitaville. If it were, you’d be a mole rat.’ He jested.\n\n‘Because it’s safe, and I need an enclosed place where I won’t be ambushed. I want to make sure you’re not a spy.’\n\n‘A spy?’\n\nToadstool said nothing and walked over to Blueberry, unlacing the back of his tunic. He inspected the wet skin on the back of his neck. ‘No brand, you’re good. I believe your story, too.’\n\nBlueberry scoffed. ‘Is this normal? Will I have to worry about spies running around?’\n\n‘Only if you’re a “merchant” like me.’ Toadstool chuckled. ‘Let’s just say I have my enemies. Some people want what I sell, and aren’t willing to buy it from me.’\n\n‘Never before have I wanted this much to go home again.’ Blueberry admitted. Toadstool re-tied the lace of Blueberry’s tunic, and stood up.\n\n‘Now I know you’re safe, we’re good to go to Amanitaville.’\n\nBlueberry nodded, and Toadstool picked up his rucksack. He pushed the rock at the entrance out of the way once more, and walking out through the cramped tunnel, they emerged at the surface. The sun shined white through the mid-morning autumnal fog.\n\nBlueberry gasped as his companion took him by the hand, two flat, ethereal appendages appearing out of the mist behind the duo’s backs.\n\n‘What are these?’ He asked, bracing himself.\n\nToadstool looked Blueberry in the eye for a second, pausing. ‘Wings.’\n\nThe two suddenly shot into the air, their wings turning purple, flapping with orange sparks. The fog dispersed as they shot above the surface of the ground, and soon they were both above the canopy. Blueberry could see the entire landscape. The sky, a distant lake, the forest that stretched from horizon to horizon.\n\n‘You can fly?’ Blueberry asked.\n\n‘You can too. Look at you.’ Toadstool unlatched his grip from his hand, and the two wings between them separated into four.\n\nBlueberry was flying, certainly. He could see a purple powdery residue sticking to the hand that was being held, which flared orange and evaporated over time with a tingling sensation. Toadstool gripped his hand once more as the powder ran out and Blueberry lost his balance. The wings merged back into two.\n\n‘This is terrifying.’ Blueberry rigidly uttered.\n\n‘Just relax. We just need to reach the other side of that lake, there my magic will be more stable, and we’ll be able to enter a gateway to Amanitaville.’\n\nBlueberry gulped, trying to control his breathing. The lake approached from the horizon, and as they crossed its shore from above, he felt a great calm take him.\n\n‘Feeling more at ease?’ Toadstool asked. ‘It’s gotta be the scenery.’\n\nBlueberry nervously laughed. ‘Yeah. I’m too used to dry shrubbery. Never seen this much water in one place apart from the oasis at my… home…’\n\n‘Oh darn.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘Well don’t worry. There’s plenty of water over where I’m from. This is only a taster of what’s to come.’\n\nBlueberry was silent.\n\n‘So what did you do to make your people hate you, if you don’t mind my asking?’ Toadstool asked.\n\nBlueberry stared down at the vast surface of the lake, he was on edge, yet calmed by the scenery at the same time. Like a clogged old dam, he couldn’t get the words out. They weren’t there. All memory of what he did to deserve his ostracism was void. His brain panicked, looking for an explanation, but every conclusion it came to felt like a half-baked lie.\n\n‘I don’t-’ He paused. ‘I have no idea. It terrifies me to think about it. I’m scared thinking of what I could have done, and I’m utterly ashamed that I’m unable to feel guilty for it.’\n\nToadstool stared at him contemplatively.\n\nBlueberry continued his monologue. ‘Thank you for your hospitality though. I wouldn’t know where to start in rebuilding a life for myself.’\n\n‘It’s no problem.’ Toadstool responded. ‘I’m really sorry to hear about your situation.’\n\nBlueberry nodded.\n\n‘Stonechild knows some of us wish we could forget our sins.’ He mumbled, almost inaudibly. The sky fell silent apart from the whistle of air past their flight.\n\n‘Lucky for us, our journey will soon be over.’ Toadstool pointed to a peninsula in the lake. ‘That place is stable. We’ll be able to go to Amanitaville there.’\n\nBlueberry was relieved to be out of the air. Once they landed, he took a moment to breathe, reorienting himself, and took a drink from the lake.\n\n‘Dizzy?’ Toadstool asked. ‘That’s normal for people new to the charm of levitation.’\n\n‘Yep.’ Blueberry gagged into the water.\n\n‘I’m just glad you had some prior exposure. You had to have used magic to get here, right? That’s how I knew it was safe. Normally, people native to this realm can't handle it.’\n\nBlueberry frowned. ‘What happens to them?’\n\n‘Stonechild…’ He sighed. ‘It’s horrid. I don’t want to say.’\n\n‘That’s fine.’ Blueberry consoled.\n\nToadstool rubbed his hands together, his palms flaring in sparks. Soon, a large circle began to rip through the fabric of space, its circumference flickering in a spinning circle of orange and purple.\n\n‘This, Blueberry, is how we can travel to my realm, where Amanitaville is.’\n\nBlueberry’s face lit up in a turmeric hue. Staring into the gateway, he could feel something familiar, as if he’d seen one before. His stomach churned looking into the spinning hole.\n\n‘It’s terrifying.’\n\n‘It’s travel.’\n\nToadstool took Blueberry by the hand, marching into the portal. For a second, Blueberry thought he could see the whole world and 6 more, but in the blink of an eye it was forgotten. \n\nOnce reality coalesced, the two were in a new realm.\n\n## Chapter 2\n\n‘Welcome to the 2nd Realm.’ Toadstool exclaimed.\n\nThis place was even stranger than the previous. The trees appeared yellow and red as if it were autumn all-year round, but the air felt as if it were summer. The sky stood pink above the ground, and the canopy was saturated with habitation.\n\nLarge, towering mushrooms littered the scenery, accompanying the trees in their stature. Some of the mushrooms looked like morels, some like agarics, others like boletes and, rarely, like ink-caps.\n\nStepping stones floated in the air, connecting the pathways made of packed clay on the upside of each branch, which ended in dangling shelters that contained beds and stored food and items.\n\nOther people, Minikin just like Toadstool, stood on the branches and on the floor. Some of them on the branches had ropes that held baskets on the end, which others on the ground placed supplies into. The majority, however, opted to transport supplies with the same magic that Toadstool had used earlier.\n\n‘This is Amanitaville?’ Blueberry asked, shaken.\n\n‘That’s right; we were in the 0th Realm before. You likely came from the 1st if you’re one of the Slugfolk.’ Toadstool explained. ‘Thankfully, you won’t have to keep track of all this, given you don’t leave for another realm.’\n\nThe gateway closing behind them, the two walked along the gravel paths built into the ground, Blueberry following Toadstool’s direction.\n\n‘My family’s home is north-west of here.’ Toadstool said, pointing in the direction.\n\nBlueberry felt uneasy. He felt as if the people they walked past were staring, at Toadstool or at himself–maybe at both of them.\n\nThe stares advanced into jeers and growls. It became clear to Blueberry, in a confusing, almost relieving way, that he wasn’t being addressed–it was Toadstool. Blueberry’s eyes darted concernedly from the hecklers to his companion.\n\n‘Thief!’ One voice shouted.\n\nToadstool kept quiet, but it was clear he was thinking.\n\n‘Not looking to buy what you have to sell, careless freak!’ Another shouted.\n\n‘Careless freak?’ Blueberry asked.\n\n‘I told you. I’m not someone to look up to.’\n\nBlueberry held a concerned look at Toadstool.\n\n‘Murderer!’ Someone exclaimed.\n\n‘Murderer?’ Blueberry yelped, stopping in his tracks. Toadstool walked onward, disregarding Blueberry’s repetition of the jeer as if he were to have meant it like everybody else.\n\nHalting after a moment, Toadstool spoke. ‘It’s more complicated than they put on. I’m not a killer, I’m not a murderer–I never laid my hands on anybody.’\n\n‘Explain yourself.’\n\n‘I…’ Toadstool stuttered. ‘I can’t.’\n\nHe continued. ‘But if I were what they said, I wouldn't be helping you. I wouldn’t be doing something good.’\n\nBlueberry said nothing.\n\n‘I’m sorry you have to be here for it.’ Toadstool apologised. ‘Normally they don’t shout like that, but I think they’re just trying to ward you off, to get you away from the “me” they have in their minds.’\n\nBlueberry remained silent, and continued onward.\n\nArriving at the foot of Toadstool’s home tree, Blueberry couldn’t help but stand in awe at the size of it–not only was it very large, but it also bore large morel mushrooms which had been hollowed and converted into living areas.\n\n‘Are you any good at climbing?’\n\n‘No,’ Blueberry explained, ‘I just slip off.’\n\n‘Fortunately, you can rest in one of the morels on the ground.’ Toadstool said, relieving Blueberry. ‘Just go around the tree-trunk.’\n\nBlueberry travelled along the circumference of the tree, attempting not to trip on the thick roots that carpeted the floor. The perimeter of the trunk measured longer than any tree Blueberry had ever seen from his old home; it challenged the width of a giant sequoia.\n\nSoon, he came across a cluster of morels. In the vicinity of each, clay chimineas puffed smoke into the air, and each mushroom was furnished with an orange wooden door and windows that peeked into their large, hulking caps. Outside of each, a network of stepping-stone paths connected each shelter, lit with lanterns of glowing crystal. Blueberry was spoiled with choice.\n\n‘Any one tickle your fancy?’ Toadstool asked.\n\n‘Let me ask first,’ Blueberry inquired, ‘How did you get these mushrooms so big?’\n\n‘They just grow like that around these parts, it’s gotta be the magic. My nation is known as Morelland for the fact that giant morels grow here.’\n\n‘I’ll just take the closest one.’ Blueberry decided.\n\n‘Fair choice.’ Toadstool bowed. ‘As long as you live under my roof, I am to serve you. A custom of the Deer Clan.’\n\n‘I’m flattered!’ Blueberry exclaimed.\n\n‘You can begin by fetching me some leaves to eat.’\n\n‘Oh…’ Toadstool sighed. ‘Not that–it is also a custom that any guests must eat only with the family, from the same reserve of food, so no one gets poisoned. Dinner time is in an hour.’\n\n‘I see. Just leave me be until the time arrives, then.’ Blueberry responded, grasping the front door of his shelter.\n\n‘No doorknob?’ He asked.\n\n‘Oh stonechild, here you go.’ Toadstool rubbed his hands together and opened the door, closing it once Blueberry had entered, with the same flaring magic that he had seen in the gateway and during their flight.\n\n‘Thank you.’\n\n‘It wasn’t a problem. I’m yours to command.’ Toadstool said.\n\nBlueberry made himself comfortable once the door closed behind him. Sitting down on one of the seats, he looked around, noting that the inside of the shelter was a realm in and of itself.\n\nThe walls were decorated with tapestries and the shelves with ornaments and lanterns containing glowing crystals to light the room. The lower room had seats carved into the fungal walls, adorned with blankets and pillows, and the upper room was decorated in the same way, only with the addition of cotton beds. It was accessible with a ladder which had clearly not been used in years.\n\n'Cozy.' he muttered to himself, watching the lights flicker orange and purple.\n\nHe looked for something to preoccupy himself with, and happened across a scroll made of tanned leaves kept closed with a ribbon. The scroll was illuminated with etched drawings beside the text, but Blueberry could not understand the writing.\n\nThe illumination seemed to tell stories of ancient civilisations, deities, and how worship used to be performed thousands of years ago. Blueberry's head tilted as he reached the end of the scroll, however. The images began to tell the story of how a civilisation made a temple to trap a swaddled baby made of rock, and how their empire fell once it couldn't protect them from evil.\n\nHe felt confused inspecting the scroll. The tanned leaf shimmered oddly in the light of the lanterns, and the image of the baby's smile glinted almost comically.\n\n'Where is the moral to this story?' He thought to himself, amused. 'Don't trap babies in temples?'\n\nUnable to take the scroll seriously any longer, he rolled up the leaves, tied the ribbon to close them, and placed them back where he found them. His attention moved to the door, which slowly opened.\n\nThere stood Toadstool, grunting. He was exerting himself as he put his effort into the slow-moving door. He made his way into the shelter, relieved to have opened it. It fell back into place with a soft thud. His eyebrows wobbled without stability.\n\n'Is everything okay?' Blueberry asked.\n\n'Yep.'\n\n'Really? You look upset.'\n\nToadstool paused, looking at the ground, then at the door, and back again.\n\n'Shit.' Toadstool uttered as the door knocked. He held his hand up at the door, bursting magic out of his fingers. A grunt rang out on the other side of the door, and the knocking stopped.\n\n'\"Family and business never meet.\" She said.' Toadstool interjected. 'Fucking liar.'\n\n'WHO?'\n\nThe door blasted open, shards of wood gliding through the air like shrapnel.\n\n'Weaselhunter.' Said the woman in the doorway.\n\n'Really shit timing, Weaze.'\n\n'Really shit goods, Toad.'\n\n'You know what I have to go through. You can't blame me for not finding the highest quality items.'\n\n'What? Last time it was a fool's gold nugget.' She mused. 'What's next? A 0th realm pen lid? And I see - you've picked up a nice, slimy, slugfolk for me.'\n\nWeaselhunter came close to Blueberry; she towered over him.\n\n'What's he for?' She asked.\n\n'I…' Toadstool stuttered.\n\n'You… got him for me? I'm flattered.' She taunted.\n\n'No!' Toadstool exclaimed. 'I saved him… he was lost.'\n\n'Has our favourite mushroom gone even more mushy?' She laughed. 'You've been like this ever since-'\n\nShe was cut off by a loud slap across the snout. Toadstool ran out of the shelter in the blink of an eye.\n\nBlueberry got up, looking Weaselhunter down, and left, looking for Toadstool.\n\nWeaselhunter appeared dumbstruck. Her greying, wiry, brown hair fell to her shoulders, and the rest of her hair was tied up into circular flower-like buns. Her bronze face was punctuated with wrinkles and her toned arms were illustrated with tattoos like the images that Blueberry had seen in the scroll.\n\nBlueberry wandered through the streets of the city, looking for his companion. He could only catch fleeting glimpses of him. Blueberry returned to the place they had entered the realm, and caught his companion before he could leave.\n\n'Where are you going?' Blueberry gasped.\n\n'Back to where I was before.' Toadstool explained. 'Coming back home was a mistake.'\n\n'But you need to spend time with your family.' Blueberry urged.\n\n'And do what? Be abused by onlookers, found by people I \"work for\", reminded of why exactly I can't return?'\n\nBlueberry stayed silent.\n\n'It's not the first dinner I've had without my family. I'll be fine.'\n\n'At least do it for me.' Blueberry responded.\n\n'Huh? What obligation do I have to you?'\n\n'I'm new to this world. I need to experience it. I'd be lost if you weren't here to give me my place.' Blueberry paused. 'And anyway. While I'm not under your roof at the moment, I'm still your guest; you know your customs.'\n\nToadstool looked at the ground, his tail stiff as it pointed toward the floor.\n\n'Dinner is in 30 minutes. I'm going to go for a walk. Don't be late; return to the shelter.'\n\nBlueberry nodded, returning. 'I hope they can use their magic to reform the door.' He thought to himself.\n\n## Chapter 3\n\nToadstool walked into the gateway. Holding his breath, the sparks of magic flared about him as he was transported. In a moment he was taken to the southern hemisphere of the 0th realm; he was in the west. The moonlight gently beamed upon his skin.\n\nHe took a moment to compose himself, shaking sparkling powder out of his hair and off his fingertips. He walked through the tropical grasslands, finding solace in the dark backdrop provided by the wet, green trees and navy sky.\n\nHe continued walking, placing his hand in the air, casting a spell. Recoiling his hand back to his side, he now knew where to go. The charm had oriented him.\n\nSmiling melancholically, he fled through the tall grass. He left behind a trail of disturbed greenery which appeared as if it were waving him goodbye. He methodically made his way to the entrance of a cave.\n\nThe ground seemed to have opened. Its gaping mouth pointed to the sky, welcoming Toadstool into its wet, dark mouth. He slowly glided over its forested lips and into the cavern, and reached the floor in the midst of the darkness that ate up his surroundings like ink.\n\nMaking use of magic once more, he drew a symbol into the palm of his hand with his finger. The symbol ignited with white light. Illuminating the cave, he walked through its natural hallways and nooks, and found an open room in the earth-hole.\n\nHe knew where this was; in fact, it was where he wanted to go, the cavern’s floor was almost completely empty save for stalagmites, moss, lichen, a small plot and a fallen block of stone in the centre. Toadstool walked closer to the plot, and fixed the stone to the plot’s head.\n\nIt was a grave.\n\n‘I’m sorry…’ Toadstool let go, kneeling graveside.\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘I know I’ve said it so many times over.’ He conceded.\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘But I’m trying to be better.’\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘I’m helping one of the Slugfolk to find a home.’ He admitted in the darkness. ‘I’m helping him live.’\n\nThe gravestone eased its posture. Toadstool perked up excitedly as he watched its response, but it only fell over.\n\n‘Fuck.’\n\nThe damaged block sat pathetically against the cold, wet bedrock.\n\n‘You’re not anything anymore.’ Toadstool snapped; the name on the stone had lost all distinction.\n\n‘I’m crazy for thinking I’ll ever be able to spend time with you again.’ His eyes welled with tears.\n\n‘But what do I expect of you? You’re just a grave.’ He continued, drawing the symbol of rest into the grave’s fluffy soil. The symbol sat on the ground. Toadstool felt as if it looked right to be there. Even if every grave would never open up again, he would still give rest to the lost–if Toadstool could, he’d make sure every grave had the same rest as this one did. Tears flowed onto the ground, watering the soil.\n\n‘I promise…’\n\nThe room echoed with his words, silent apart from them and the dripping of water.\n\n‘I promise to the Petrified Child I’ll leave this life behi-’ Toadstool’s words were cut off by the shout of a woman.\n\n‘You’ll leave what!?’ Weaselhunter cut through the silence.\n\nToadstool jumped.\n\n‘Like that’s true. You still owe me your continued career.’\n\n'How did you find me?' He exclaimed.\n\nWeaselhunter smirked, pausing. 'Our patrols.'\n\n‘What did I even do to deserve this?’ Toadstool screamed, red in the face, rivers flowing from his eyes.\n\n‘You signed up, murderer.’\n\nToadstool yelped, sobbing over the grave. ‘I can’t escape you!’\n\n‘You can’t escape yourself. Your actions. Any other of us would have never let them hurt one of our family. But you–you let it happen. You killed her.’\n\nToadstool continued crying. ‘I know, I know, I know, I’m a murderer!’ He wiped the tears from his face with his scarf.\n\n‘That’s right.’ Weaselhunter encouraged. ‘Stonechild cut you down for it.’ She paused, watching his reaction sadistically, picking back up the conversation with a proposition. ‘But… I need gold from a murderer.’\n\n‘You need it from me?’\n\n‘10 ancient human coins, truly golden. You have a week.’\n\nToadstool didn’t have it in him to say no; his throat locked up before he could get a squeak out. ‘Why not bronze?’ He thought to himself in his silent misery. ‘Why not steel?’\n\nWeaselhunter walked out of the cavern as Toadstool stood, broken, begging and pleading on the inside. Pausing, she said one last thing.\n\n‘Say \"hi\" to your mother for me.’ She shot out of the entrance of the cave in a blink.\n\nAs if he were finally able to pry his mouth open, Toadstool muttered something to himself.\n\n‘Fucker.’\n\n## Chapter 4\n\nToadstool arrived at his home.\n\nFor the first time in what felt as if it were ages, the tree stood familiarly tall over him, but the midday fog drew out its worst features. The winding, bending branches that snaked their way out from the trunk waved unsettlingly in the wind with plumes of golden leaves like flames angrily spitting and sputtering. He tried his hardest to look away from it, but the dangerous, burning fire he imagined in the canopy drew him close as if it were warm.\n\nHe couldn't help but go home again.\n\n'Blueberry!' He called out. 'It's dinner time.'\n\nThe Slugfolk sheepishly came out from his shelter through the newly doorless entrance.\n\n'What's her name… Wease?' Blueberry squeaked.  \n'Weaselhunter?'\n\n'She's your friend?' He asked.\n\nToadstool looked down at the floor, his tail limp and deflated. Blueberry had no answer.\n\n'Dinner is up in the canopy. I'll take you up.'\n\n'Sounds like a plan.'\n\nToadstool took Blueberry by the hand, taking him up with two fluttering wings of purple mist. They droned repeatedly but the duo paid them no mind.\n\nToadstool hoped that the dinner would go well. Having paid a visit to his family earlier, he knew that they'd have prepared a meal for the two. At the canopy, his family were all sitting on a pathway atop a branch.\n\n'What's for dinner?' Toadstool said with childlike glee.\n\n'The children have sweetberries, me and your father have nuts, and you… and your friend… have a tadpole.'\n\nToadstool scoffed. 'A tadpole? For the two of us?'\n\nBlueberry looked at the food, at Toadstool, and at the family. 'I'll have the tail.'\n\n'Does he think this is normal?' Toadstool thought to himself, furrowing his brow. 'Do slugfolk eat tadpoles?'\n\n'Is something wrong?' Said one of Toadstool's young siblings, known as Toad Frog, noticing his expression.\n\n'Stoolie's a picky eater.' Said another of his siblings.\n\nToadstool poked the dead creature which flopped limply on the clay surface of the path. 'Raw?' He asked.\n\n'Of course.' His mother said bluntly.\n\nBlueberry had already begun trying to eat it, his tongue scraping against its tail, but Toadstool wanted to vomit.\n\n'Toadstool's turning green.' Said another child.\n\n'I can't stomach this!' He yelled, kicking the tadpole onto the ground. It hit the ground distantly with a wet thud.\n\nBlueberry jumped. 'You don't want it?'\n\n'I don't know if it's different where you came from, but we don't even eat tadpoles here!' Toadstool growled.\n\n'We eat frogspawn.'\n\n'Good for you.' Toadstool grunted.\n\n'If you don't want to eat what your father and I caught for you, then why are you even here?' Petal jeered.\n\n'Because you're my family!'\n\n'And family means so much to you?'\n\nToadstool's eyes began to well with tears. He tried to admit that yes, he really does care about his family, if only his throat could let anything out in-between his cries.\n\n'Aren't ready to admit you only care about yourself?' She continued.\n\n'He cares about me, right?' Blueberry butted in.\n\n'Shut your mouth, slug.' She said; Blueberry gasped. 'He only helped you out to prove how good a person he is. But the truth is-'\n\nToadstool's claws dug into the pathway. As Petal spoke, he let out a cry. 'I didn't kill her! I didn't even want her to join the Bandits!'\n\n'But you seemed ever so gleeful to know you weren't alone in your profession when she did.' Petal pointed out.\n\n'Who did you kill?' Blueberry muttered.\n\n'Nobody.' Toadstool squeaked. He knew what Petal would say if he were to pause; he took a deep breath in and continued. 'My cousin. Toad Blossom.'\n\n'My niece.' Petal said.\n\n'Cousin Blossie?' another of Toadstool's siblings said.\n\nToadstool wheezed involuntarily. 'Blossie… She joined the bandits. I'm sure she just wanted to be closer to me, right? But I'm not a good person. I don't work to do good things. I work for myself, alone. But I felt so happy to finally have a friend, a cousin, to work alongside; I wasn't alone, until she died.'\n\nPetal herself began to cry. She and her husband's small hands cupped a couple of the childrens' ears. Toadstool let out a tear, and nudged Blueberry to help hide the children from the truth.\n\n'I wasn't even there when they took her from us.’ He emphasised. ‘It was another bandit gang that got to her; she wouldn't give them what they hadn't paid for. She didn’t deserve it, she wasn’t meant for this line of work, and she paid with her life.’\n\nThe pathway fell silent and empty apart from the quiet cries amongst the family and Toadstool's shaky panting. It took a moment for the dialogue to continue once more.\n\n'...If it weren't for you and your Stonechild forsaken job,' Petal said in-between her tears, 'She'd be here eating with us.'\n\nToadstool choked up. Nothing escaped his lips. Looking around, he realised that Blueberry wasn’t there with them. Frog looked up at Toadstool. ‘The slug jumped down.’\n\n‘Stonechild damn the whole thing.’ Toadstool uttered.\n\nToadstool didn’t even glance at his family when he hopped down from the branch in search of Blueberry. ‘I can help you! Blueberry, damn it!’ He called out, his words echoing through the forest.\n\nToadstool knew that Blueberry couldn’t have gone far. Not only was he fragile and soft, but he was also too slimy to climb down. Toadstool frantically searched the lower branches, but it was in vain.\n\n‘I can’t lose another friend!’ He called out.\n\nThe forest began to spin around him as his chest tightened. In the streaks of colour, swiftly blurring around him, he could see a figure on one of the branches. It was dark, shimmery, and had Blueberry’s clothes. It was him.\n\nBefore Toadstool could think, he ran toward his companion; his feet moved faster than his reason.\n\n‘I can’t lose you.’ He panted.\n\n‘You can’t lose me? You don’t know me. If anything, I’m doing you a favour by leaving. This way you can’t kill me.’\n\n‘I wouldn’t kill you!’\n\nBlueberry laughed; the wonder in his eyes had faded. ‘That’s what you said about Blossom.’\n\nToadstool was speechless as Blueberry walked further down the branch. In a blink, he had already consulted a labourer to send him down to the ground on a platform attached to a rope. He was gone.\n\nFrom leagues away, Toadstool watched as his friend grew smaller and smaller in the wooded cityscape as he walked. He probably didn’t even know where he was going; at least until a streetside hag caught his attention.\n\nThe two, like ants, crawled into an alleyway. Having disappeared behind the tree-stumps and organic buildings of the city, the alley flared with the colours of magic. Toadstool threw his hat against the clay beneath his feet. ‘Fuck!’\n\nHe took the opportunity to float down to the ground. Running to the alleyway, an old woman stood alone; one large eye of hers was grey, and her crooked form was draped in rags. Four words scraped out of her mouth like a broken violin.\n\n‘Mossrot sends his regards.’\n\nToadstool’s brow furrowed. ‘Send me to my friend!’ he growled.\n\n‘Oh, to another place you will be reviled?’\n\n‘To my friend.’ He angrily enunciated.\n\n‘To a place you must be changed to enter. Hand over your magic.’\n\nToadstool eased in confusion ‘My… Magic?’\n\n‘You lack the scars of purity.’ She responded, her clawed, thin fingers tracing two bowed scars below her curved ears.\n\nToadstool grunted, standing straight. ‘I see. I’m not giving in, you freak.’\n\nThe woman cackled and spun in amusement. ‘Freak!’\n\n‘Yes!’\n\nShe laughed even harder. ‘Freak! Freak!’\n\nToadstool’s mouth stayed closed, his heart felt as if it were sinking.\n\n‘Freak! Freak! Freak!’\n\nBefore she could repeat it once more, Toadstool had begun to run away.\n\nHe couldn’t stand to remain in the city. This place that once felt like home, years ago, was still hostile and uninviting. Too many people could understand the city, live well within it, but Toadstool never could wrap his mind around how it all worked. It was a mistake to return, a mistake to try to show he wasn’t the murderer, the freak, that people saw him as. He knew that he wasn’t made for that life.\n\nFleeing was always a safe option. Toadstool sighed, relieved to be away from the horror of civilization. His eyes happily adjusted to the sight of less and less people as his legs fluttered away, but as the world reduced to the wilderness, he felt empty. He patted down his pockets, thinking he may have dropped something, but everything was in check. He felt lonely.\n\nIt was the first time he had felt lonely in a long, long time. The last time he had felt like this was when Blossom had died, and since those feelings had faded he’d settled in disdain for his bandit ‘friends,’ his family, and every other person that held him guilty. With Blueberry gone, it felt as if this world was still stubbornly chipping away at his already empty heart. His head bowed in contempt and pity for himself.\n\n‘Koala.’ He muttered, alone. ‘She can help me.’\n\nIf there were anybody who could cheer the bandit up, it was Koala; but Toadstool hadn't seen her in years. He didn't know if she knew, if her home was safe, but he needed hope and faith in destiny—despite how much it had used and abused him for no discernible reason—that there was at least one place he could call home. He hoped that Koala could be that for him.\n\n## Chapter 5\n\n‘Get up.’\n\n‘In an hour… or a year.’\n\n‘For the trees’ sake, Riverbell, get up. You're expected at the town centre by midday.’\n\n‘Midday? Goodness! Blueberry, You should have woken me up sooner.’\n\n‘I did.’\n\nRiverbell sighed, looking up at the ray of sunlight dazzling through the half-eaten leaves above her.\n\n‘What am I needed for?’\n\n‘To arbitrate the latest petition.’\n\n‘Are my people not able to decide for themselves?’\n\n‘That's exactly what they're doing, it was only your father that made it so the sovereign had to give assent.’\n\n‘Don’t mention my father.’","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["writing","draft","if only"]},"/writing/every-force-of-nature":{"title":"Every Force of Nature","content":"So, every force of nature showed  \nthe shattered ways the crystal glowed.\n\nA gemstone fit to lose our minds,  \nthat let us know such things remote;\nthe broken ways the aura binds  \nthe empty days that time had wrote.\n\nThis world was made to counterplot,  \nnow earth’s inventions wait to rot.\n\nIn tangled vines the world calls out,  \nthrough all the cracks it promptly got  \nfrom days or years as shards about,  \nand now all order earth forgot.\n\nAnd every force of nature showed  \nthe shattered ways the crystal glowed.\n### Notes\nThis poem was written in 2023, and focusses on the nature of the cosmos in the book; especially musing on the existence of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) and the shattered realms.

And the two Judges lived in the forest of Ngwasai Oskaya[^1]. The first Judge was named 'Udrui[^2],' for it brought light to the forest, and the second Judge was named 'Ena[^3],' for it was an attendant in the darkness. And Udrui resided in the east, and Ena the west.\n### The Plants and Waters Created\nNow Udrui would often become tired, and would sleep in the cradle of the eastern horizon, and this would be the night. And in the night, Ena would emerge from the western cradle, to watch over and illumine the forest in the darkness. But the forest was empty, and lacked order, and was only dust. And so, when the two Judges would discuss their concerns, Ena said, 'What is a forest?' But Udrui had no answer, and so they discussed what a forest should be, for they were able to decree such a matter. And so Ena said, 'let stalks and flowers and leaves, all bearing fruit and seeds, to emerge from the dust.' And Udrui made it so, and they emerged, and Udrui named them 'plants.' And the two saw what they had created, that it was good, and they were glad, and ate the fruits of the plants that they had decreed to emerge from the dust.\n\nAnd so, Udrui went into its home, and slept, but the plants withered without the Judge's light. And so Ena was afraid, and cared for the plants. And the Judge created clouds in the sky, that water may fall from them into the ground, and form rivers, and the Judge decreed that the plants should be nourished by the rains and the dust of the ground. And the plants lived, and they were thankful to their creators, and worshipped them. And it came to pass that the plants reached the ends of their lives at the appointed time, and let down their seeds, and their children sprouted from the ground, and ate of the dust of their parents.\n### The Angels and Mountains Created\nThe next day, Udrui emerged from the eastern horizon, and observed the rains that fell from the clouds and the plants that worshipped. But Ena was lonely, and came to Udrui, and said, 'Should we be the only ones to enjoy the forest? Come, let us create angels as companions for ourselves, as a testament to our glory, that they might hold dominion over the forest, and worship us.' And Udrui made it so, and a host of Angels emerged from the ether and began to make garden of the forest. And the Judges saw what they had created, that it was good, and ate fruits with the Angels. And the Angels were glad, and worshipped their creators.\n\nAnd so, Udrui went into its home, and slept, and the Angels tended to the plants in the night and the day, for they were holy in the eyes of the Judges. And the next day, Udrui awoke, and illumined the whole creation. But Ena came to Udrui, and said, 'Is it good that all things should be kept at the same level? For you and I are holy, and yet we share our portion with weeds, and the angels, who are beneath us and above the plants, they share our portion as well. Come, let us create high places for ourselves, and low places for the least holy of the holy things we have created for ourselves.' And so Udrui made it so, and mountains arose from the ground, reaching into the clouds that nourished the plants, for the clouds were holy. And there were left chasms in the surface of the earth, where the water collected, and these became lakes and seas, into which the rivers flowed.\n## Chapter Two\n### Eyolith Menna Corrupts Ena\nNow there was an angel which was unholy in the depths of its heart, and the angel was named 'Eyolith Menna[^4].' And Eyolith Menna hid in the depths of the ocean to hide from all things holy, for it was unholy. But as Ena was walking through the forest in the night, there was a rupture in the seas, and out of this rupture emerged a cloud which carried Eyolith Menna. And the cloud came to Ena, and spoke. 'Peace and favour upon you, my shepherd in the night, my Judge over the forest.' And Ena said, 'Hello, you who are amongst the angels of our creation, what is it you wish to discuss?' Eyolith Menna responded, 'No unholy thing, my creator, only that you give ear to my musings.' And so, Ena said, 'Go on.' And so Eyolith Menna said, 'Do you see it well that Judges and Angels only should enjoy the forest? No, it is no good thing, and I say that it would be a good thing that you should create living spirits, formed of the darkness of the forest, for how will the Angels see you as great if there is no ungreat thing below you?'\n\nBut Ena was not amused, saying, 'Is your method of worshipping me to make me to falter and marr the forest with living creatures of dirt?' And Eyolith Menna said, 'Nay, but to make you to be exalted. For what is one unholy thing when there is already a least holy thing?.' And Ena looked to the ground, saying, 'You are right to say that there is a least holy thing.' And Eyolith Menna said, 'Yes! And what is one more creation to feed upon the least holy things, to praise you, and to stand against you–to prove your greatness?' But Ena was angered, saying, 'Is it your wish to sway my hand from order and greatness? Be away from me, you evil thing.' And Eyolith Menna said nothing, and crawled into the dark places of the forest, and was glad, for it knew it had corrupted Ena's heart.\n### Eyolith Menna is Punished\nAnd so the morning returned, and Udrui returned from the eastern horizon, and was looking over the forest, at all the things that had been made, when it saw Ena kneeling at the foot of the mountains. And so Udrui asked, 'Why are you despondent? Is not the holiness of our creation enough for you?' And Ena said, 'Nay, but I am saddened by the unholy things I heard while you slept.' Udrui said, 'Unholy? There is a least holy thing, but no unholy thing in the forest you and I designed. Are you to suppose we have created an unholy thing?' And Ena said, 'Nay, for we have not created any unholy thing, but I have heard an unholy idea from the one who wished to marr our creation, the angel Eyolith Menna.' and Udrui was angered, and said, 'I will make it that Eyolith Menna is destroyed, and it shall be imprisoned above the clouds, condemned to burn in the night, and to be suffocated in the light of day.' And Ena said nothing, for its heart was corrupted. And so Eyolith Menna was taken and condemned to burn in the night and be suffocated in the light of day, and was the first of the stars which are imprisoned above the clouds, and was the north star.\n### The Spirits of Darkness Created\nBut because Ena's heart was corrupted, it sat in the dark places of the forest, and was shrowded in shadow and the darkness of night. And it decreed, 'I shall take the tar of the forest, and create spirits of the tar, and thus I shall name the spirits, 'Darkness,' for they shall be hidden from the light.' And so the Spirits of Darkness were breathed out from the tar pits, and began to graze upon the forest, and destroy it. And Ena saw what it had created, and was glad, because it was corrupted, and saw them as a testament to the glory of the Judges and the Angels and the Plants. And the next morning, the Spirits of Darkness hid in the dark places of the forest, afraid of the light that had emerged from the eastern horizon with Udrui. And for longer than men have breathed in our time did the Spirits of Darkness live and hide in the dark places where they were formed.\n### The Spirits of Darkness Discovered\nNow the next night the spirits emerged to graze, and destroy, and consume the forest once more, and this they did every moment the light was not exposing their sin, for it was by this destruction that the spirits were fed. But once, as Udrui emerged from the east, and looked over the forest, it was barren, and empty, for the Spirits of Darkness had wholly consumed it. And Udrui was exceeding wroth, and came to Ena, and said, 'What have you done?' But Ena was silent, for it was corrupted. And Udrui said, 'You spoke to me of unholy thoughts of angels in ancient times, and behold! This most unspeakable, this unholy thing has occurred; I see you have been corrupted. Do you think me stupid, that I should not know it was you to cause this? For no dust, no water, no plant, nor any angel could commit such an act of destruction as you have committed this day.'\n### Udrui Murdered\nAnd Ena had no words, but the Spirits of Darkness had a flame of anger ignited from within them. And the Spirits of Darkness emerged from the dark places of the forest, and Udrui was horrified, saying, 'Are you the instruments of my companion's sin?' and the spirits spoke, 'Nay, but we are your companion's heirs.' And Udrui said, 'If you are its heirs, then let you inherit the guilt it gained from lending ear to Eyolith Menna, for you have destroyed the forest in your sin.' And the spirits leaped upon Udrui, and battled it, and the land was overcome by darkness as the spirits murdered their god. And when the battle was done, the burning corpse of the Judge loomed from above the clouds, and there was no life within it.\n## Chapter Three\n### The Aftermath\nUpon this, Ena saw clearly, and it said, 'What have you done?' For it was deeply sorrowful. And Ena said, 'Do you suppose that you should consume me as you have Udrui?' For it was afraid for its own life. And the spirits said, 'Nay, for you created us. The light sought to expose and destroy us, but you lead us in the night.' And Ena was wroth, and said, 'Udrui sought to expose and destroy you not because it was evil, but because you are unholy, and you are the spawn of the machinations of a demon; look up to the north star, and let its fire serve as a reminder to you for the wages of sin.' And the Spirits of Darkness were afraid, and said, 'Surely, you would not burn us as the north star burns.' And Ena said, 'You burn yourselves in your iniquity.'\n### The Spirits of Darkness Given Flesh\nAnd so Ena decreed, 'O, Spirits of Darkness, you shall be imprisoned within bodies of dust and souls of tar, and be subject to the limits of your flesh. Your bodies will be weakened by age, and worn down by the toil that you shall toil under the burning corpse of Udrui, that you should not starve, and thirst, and die. But you certainly shall die, for your appointed time will come, and you will burn amongst the stars, and your fire will only end once the punishment for your iniquity is complete.' And the Spirits of Darkness were given bodies of flesh, and were beasts, and their flesh wept before their lungs first breathed.\n\nAnd the host of beasts looked toward the sky, and with their first breath, spoke as one, 'If we are to die, let our legacy not be cut off forever.' And Ena looked down, and said, 'Aye; I decree that a portion of you be set aside, and, as plants bore seed, you too should bear children, and your children should bear children. But you shall also suffer the agony of labour, as a reminder of your iniquity. And you shall have many husbands, and through them many children, and you shall be queens, with authority over others.'\n### The Realms Shattered\nNow when the Spirits of Darkness had murdered Udrui, the Judge's power was great, and when it died, an energy proceeded from its spirit. And this energy overcame the forest, and warped the laws of nature, and thus the cosmos was so warped that it shattered into a myriad pieces. And once the spirits were given flesh, Ena took the beasts, and put them in the shattered realms, and it sowed new seeds into the barren soil of the realms, and thus emerged new plants. And as the fragments of the body of Udrui flowed overhead to fuel the plants which the beasts consumed, the beasts had children, and their children had children, and it came to pass that they forgot their ancient knowledge, and they knew not how their mothers murdered the sun, and shattered the realms into pieces, and condemned their children to prisons of flesh. And so the beasts had proliferated across the remains of creation, and made for themselves homes upon the planets. And it came to pass that the beasts' children had unfolded into different species, and kinds, and races.\n## Chapter Four\n### The Beasts Forget\nNow the Judge was sorrowful that the beasts had forgotten all things holy, and it said to Qherenna[^5], the angel of dirt, 'have you seen Shinra[^7], whose kind dwells amongst the trees? Let her most favourable husband lie with her, and let the seed sown within her womb be an herald of faith of all things holy, that the beasts should believe and remember through her seed.' And so Qherenna agreed, for it was faithful. And in the land of Kharra-Eyan[^10] lived the woman called Shinra, who was advanced in years, and was barren. And at dusk did Qherenna come to her in a dream, saying, 'Shinra, let it be known to you that you shall be the vessel to carry the seed of faith.' but Shinra said, 'What are you? Have you come to take me in my sleep?' And Qherenna said, 'No, but I am come to show you the will of the Judge. You believe that I am come to take you in your sleep, but I say that you shall be blessed to see your daughter live till the day she is counted among women, then I shall take you.' And Shinra was afraid, and said, 'This cannot be, for you are only a dream; be gone from me!' But Qherenna was upset, and said, 'I rebuke you in the name of Ena the Judge, for we are holy.' And Shinra said, 'you are holy? I have not heard of such beings.' and Qherenna said, 'Yes, and it is for this sake that you shall be the vessel to carry the seed of faith.'\n### Keille is Born\nAnd so Shinra was swayed, her heart was opened. Seeing this, the angel said, 'Shinra, you who are blessed amongst the women of your kind, let it be known that it is Ena's will that you should carry a child, and when this child is born you will name her Eyorna[^8], for she is the seed of which I spoke.' But Shinra said, 'But, holy one, I am advanced in years, and have passed the time of birthing; my progeny is but an empty plain where nothing grows, not even the weeds; I am barren.' And Qherenna, knowing this, said, 'You percieve yourself to be barren, but it is this disbelief that salts the earth of your flesh. Believe in all of the holy things and bring forth your child.' And so Shinra believed, and it came to pass that she laid with her most favourable husband, and was with child. But when the child was born, Shinra was afraid, and said to her husband, 'Surely I will die if this child is to be the seed of faith.' And her husband was unfaithful in his heart, and said, 'Then let us name her not 'Eyorna' as the angel commanded. For if she is not named Eyorna, then you surely will not die upon the day she is counted among women.' And so Shinra named her child 'Keille[^9],' against the commandments of the angel Qherenna and the Judge.\n### Keille's Dream\nAnd so it came to pass that Keille grew in the disbelief of her mother and father, and she was a forager for her family. And the day before she was counted among women, on the last day of the seventh month, it happened that as she laid her head upon the ground to sleep, she was struck with a dream of the angel Qherenna, who said, 'Keille, listen and behold the angel of the dirt upon which you slumber!' And Keille was surprised, for she had not seen an angel till that moment, and said, 'What are you?' And Qherenna said, 'I am Qherenna, an angel amongst the holy ones of the Judge.' and Keille said, 'Have you come to upset my family?' For when any mention of holy things was made, her mother went silent. And Qherenna said, 'Nay, but to bring faith. I tell you that you have been brought up in the falsehood of the disbelief of your mother and father, and I am come to call you to be a prophet.' And Keille said, 'Dare you not to dishonour my mother and father.' But Qherenna said with a loud voice, as thunder, 'they bring their dishonour upon themselves, Eyorna.' And Keille was as if she were struck, and said, 'What is this name, *Eyorna*, that you call me?' And Qherenna said, 'I tell you that this is the name that you ought to have been called, in accordance with what is good in the eyes of the angels and the Judge, for you were sown in the womb of your mother for the purpose of being a seed of faith among your kind.' And Keille said, 'You must teach me of the decrees of the Judge if I am to be a prophet.' And so Qherenna said, 'Yes, and I tell you that before the sun rises in the morning, you will have been shown the decrees of the Judge, and you will truly be the prophet you were made to become.'\n\nAnd so Qherenna disappeared into the dream-ether, and The Judge, Ena, emerged from the darkness. And Keille trembled, for she could not comprehend the vastness and greatness of the moon before her, in her dream. And Ena turned around to face Keille, and it's face was not obscured in shadow, and said, 'do you now see and understand that I, the Judge, am holy?' And Keille said, 'yes,' but she found it difficult to speak, for she was so afraid. And Ena said, 'you find it difficult to speak in my presence, but I tell you that after the sun rises in the morning, I will speak through you, and you will speak well.'\n\n[^1]: *nwasáį oskáya*, meaning 'The First Forest.'\n[^2]: *údrï*, meaning 'The Sun.'\n[^3]: *éną*, meaning 'The Moon.'\n[^4]: *éyolith ménna*, meaning 'The Demon of Life.'\n[^5]: *qherénna,* meaning 'Angel of Kherell (the Planet),' or 'Angel of Dirt.'\n[^7]: *cinrą,* meaning 'Clay.'\n[^8]: *eyórna*, meaning 'Seed.'\n[^9]: *keillę,* meaning 'Life.'\n[^10]: *khárra eyán*, meaning 'Steppe of the Child.'","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":["writing","lore","mythology"]},"/writing/sarvaran-epic-narrative":{"title":"The Sarvaran Epic Narrative","content":"## SCRIPTURA EX MUNDO PRAE ET POST FRACTO\n### Chapter 1\n### The Cosmos Given Shape\nBefore Lunuth had first sprouted, before it had been ground into flour or baked into bread, the [first Judge and the second Judge](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) ruled the cosmos, to give it order. And the second Judge was subordinate to the First, and was not able to decree the laws of nature, for it was a counsellor to the First.\n\nBut the cosmos was destitute, and shapeless. And so the second Judge said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given shape.' Hearing this, the First decreed that the cosmos must be given shape, and from the void emerged dust and water, all of the material of the cosmos.\n\nBut the Judges could not see their creation, and thus the second Judge said, 'we must create a light, so that we may see our creation.' Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that a light may be created, and from the void emerged flames bright enough that they should see their entire creation. And the Judges named this light, 'Sun.'\n\nBut all things were at rest, and without order. And so the second Judge  said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given order.' But the First said, 'this is not a task for us, but for another rank.' And so the First created the [Angels](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) to govern the materials of the cosmos, according to the laws of nature. And the Judges contained the laws within an immanent energy throughout all of the cosmos, and named this energy, '[Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md),' for they had invisioned it.\n\nAnd the Angels had license to decree all things within their dominion, and the Angels looked upon the cosmos, decreeing, 'it is good that the dust and water should collect in lands and seas, and that the lands should collect in planets by the sun, and that the seas should collect in oceans on the planets.' And so the lands collected in planets, and moons, and asteroids, and the seas collected in oceans, which were upon the lands.\n### The Second Judge's Covetousness and the Spirits of Darkness Created\nNow the second Judge was covetous of the first Judge's authority, saying, 'why should my superior and my subordinates decree all things, and I not, but rather to counsel them? Is not the beauty that has been created my own, for I advised its creation?' And so the second Judge hid from the First in secret, and decreed new laws of nature. And the Second contained these laws within an energy incarnate in spirits[^1], and named this energy, 'Darkness,' for it was hidden from the First and the Angels.\n\nAnd the [spirits of Darkness](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) asked the second Judge, 'O glorious, may you please fill us, that we may not be dishonourably hungry, and that our hunger may not dishonour you?' And so the second Judge gave the spirits dust to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, do you mean to dishonour us further? Fill us with something that should match your glory, that we may be a testament to it.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a moon to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, you dishonour yourself if you are to suppose that this matches your glory! Fill us with something greater.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a planet to eat, but the spirits were not filled.\n\nNow the spirits of Darkness did not fear judgement, as they were hidden. Distrusting their creator, they saw it well to consume other things, and thus began to eat other moons, other planets, and to drink seas, till there was nothing left but the Sun, and the Judges, and the Angels. Now the first Judge was horrified by the devestation that had been unleashed by the spirits, saying to its companion, 'why have you created these spirits? Do you not know it dishonours you to destroy the cosmos we gave shape to? I will surely have to destroy these spirits, lest they destroy the cosmos at last.' But the spirits, hearing that they should be destroyed, set themselves against the first Judge, to consume it.\n### the First Judge Destroyed and the Cosmos Shattered\nBut the first Judge and the Angels battled the spirits of Darkness, decreeing that each spirit should be returned to the cosmos as energy and matter. Now the advantage of the spirits was too great, and the Judge could not see them well. And it came to pass that the spirits defeated the Judge, and consumed it. But the power of the first Judge was too great, even in death, and the cosmos and everything within it was [shattered](cosmology/shattering.md), and scattered across many [realms](cosmology/realms.md).\n\nAnd so the surviving spirits of Darkness asked, 'O glorious, are we not now a testament to your glory?' But the Judge was ashamed of the consequences of its actions, and its heart was set against the spirits, saying, 'surely, you will not defeat me as you have consumed my companion.' And the spirits said, 'yes, for you are glorious.' But the Judge wept, saying, 'my companion was right, you were never to be the one testament to my glory, but rather this cosmos of our design. I see now that you lack glory, and your existence will forever shine unfavourably upon me.' And the spirits were afraid, saying, 'do you intend to destroy us?' And the Judge said, 'nay, for I cannot destroy, but I will create a punishment worthy of your iniquity.'\n## Chapter 2\n### New Laws of Nature Decreed and Spirits Given Form\nNow [the Judge](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) resided within the [heavens](cosmology/heavens), which were above and inbetween the [shattered realms](cosmology/realms). And thus it decreed new laws of nature, that the remnants of the cosmos may be protected from further destruction. And the Judge contained the new laws within an energy to replace the energy of Alucinara, and the Judge named this new energy, '[justification](cosmology/justification.md),' for the spirits of Darkness were justified and punished for their iniquity.\n\nAnd so the Judge took the energy of [Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md), and contained it within crystals, saying, 'the beauty of the old laws of the Angels shall appear from within beautiful crystals.' Also the Judge took the energy of [Darkness](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md), and contained the spirits within bodies of pitch, saying, 'it is befitting that you should be like filth, collecting in the dark places of the earths, for you are deserving of punishment.'\n\nBut the spirits of darkness were unhappy with their bodies, saying, 'we must escape the dark places of the earths.' And so they called out to the [Angels](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md), saying, 'are you not unhappy having authority over the dirt? Come, let us create new bodies for us, that you may have authority over something greater.' And so the Angels formed bodies of clay for the spirits, and the spirits of pitch resided within them, and escaped the dark places of the earths.\n### The Spirits Fired into Flesh, Stars, and Kinds\nNow the Judge was upset when it heard of this, saying, 'you have once again commited an act of iniquity against my decree.' But the spirits gloated, and said, 'are you not ashamed? for we have escaped the dark places of the earth, and created new bodies for ourselves greater than any thing you could create.' And the Judge was deeply wroth, saying, 'a false belief has sprouted within you, that you are greater than I, but I say that you inherit your greatness from me. I see that your new bodies are great, for they were created by the Angels, but the Angels are from me.' \n\nBut the spirits of Darkness would not listen, and so the Judge said, 'I decree that your bodies be fired into flesh, that you may toil to consume one another to survive, only to age and perish in the order of your years. And in death, you will burn within the heavens, as stars.' And so the Judge send a flame from the Suns upon the spirits, that they may be fired into flesh, as living beings. And the Judge said, 'I grant you one good thing, that you may bear heirs, and build families, that your legacy is not forgotten, and that the balance of life and death is even, and good.' And so the Judge sent a few spirits down upon the lands and seas, and the rest it kept within the heavens, to burn as stars, and they burn in constellation with one another to this day.\n\nAnd it came to pass that [the living beings](cosmology/living-beings.md) made homes for themselves upon the earths, but some planets were inhospitable. And the living beings were separated in kinds from one another by the Angels, into 'plants,' and 'animals.' And so the plants fed upon the light of suns and were humble, and the animals fed upon all other living beings and were not humble, and so the plants were given many years to live, but the animals were given less. And the Angels also appointed another kind, 'mould', to fulfil the laws of decay and perishing. And another kind, '[people](tags/people)', was set apart from the animals, to be a kind abounding with wisdom and faith.\n### The People Begin to Worship the Angels\nAnd the people were separated into many kinds among themselves. Some were separated from squirrels, called 'Minikin', and some from slugs, and some from apes. But the Judge looked upon the Minikin, and said, 'this kind is good, for they have the means to master the laws of Alucinara and Justification for righteous purposes.' And the Judge said to the Angels, 'come, let us will teach them of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, that they may be made wise in the fear of death and worship me.' And so the Judge and the Angels taught the Minikin of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, and they were wise in the fear of death. And the Minikin were settled in the 2nd realm, within the land of Deshwacath[^2], in the continent of Tseireph. And there the minikin built temples unto the Judge, and worshipped.\n\nBut it came to pass that the Minikin began to worship the Angels, for they could not discern the greatness of the Judge from the greatness of the Angels, for their minds were paltry compared to the celestial beings. And some Angels were evil, and merrymade in the misdirection of worship, and granted the petitions of the misfaithful in return for worship and sacrifice. And so the Judge's heart was deeply afflicted, and it was aggrieved by the false-worship of the angels, and cried out, 'O Angels! How many mistakes must I make before I learn–now I receive no praise, and no worship, for I have made yet another mistake. How it should have been me to die in place of you, O my superior companoon! For I am of lesser character than you, and the world would be exceeding great if I had not I destroyed you in my iniquity.'\n### The Judge Becomes the Petrified Child\nAnd the people heard this in an apparition, and were confused, saying, 'surely our creator has gone insane! It grieves for our faith, yet does not preserve us as the Angels do.' And so the Minikin priests went unto the Judge in the temples, asking, 'are you well?' But the Judge said, 'nay, for my heart is deeply afflicted, I have made another mistake, and the Angels are another testament to my iniquity, and I grieve for my companion, whom I destroyed in my iniquity.' And the Judge said also, 'You misplace your faith toward the mistakes of your creator, but I tell you that it it righteous that you should worship me alone.'\n\nAnd the priests said, 'O creator, how we did not know! Surely, you must atone for your iniquity, for you said to the mothers and fathers of our ancestors that pride is transgression, and yet you do not repent for your own sin.' And the Judge's heart was deeply moved, and the Judge cried out in the temples, 'it behoves me to redeem myself.' And so the Judge lifted its voice to all people in a hallucination, saying, 'I decree that I should be bound by the one duty now to protect the people whom I created an eld ago and punished for their iniquity.'\n\nAnd so the Judge birthed its spirit from itself into an offspring; a child, that it may be humble among people. And the child was to be made of stone, petrified by the Judge's memories of evil, and it was charged with the one duty to protect the people its parent had created. And so the Judge was no more, for its spirit now resided within the child it had become. And the minikin looked upon the child and named it, 'the Petrified Child.'\n### The People Create the Watchstones and Forget the Petrified Child\nNow [the Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md)'s vision was greatly limited, and could not see, and it was not able to protect the Minikin well. And the child came into the temples and said to the priests, 'may you please carve eyes into the rocks for me, that I may see, and protect you?' And so the people carved the eyes into stone, and named them 'watchstones.' The people built watchstones in cliff-faces, boulders, rocks, and pebbles, and kept them as charms within their pockets, that they may be protected from the evil of one another and the beastly kinds of the animals.\n\nBut some minikin were evil, and secretly remained in worship of the Angels, and hid the watchstones. And there were no watchstones in the temples, and in homes, and it was in these places that the people hurt one another, and worshiped false-gods, and were not righteous unto the child, and did not fear it. And so the minikin did not teach their daughters and sons of the child, and died, and their children lacked the inheritence of faith that protected them. And it came to pass as the generations passed that the watchstones were worn down to dust, and were no more.\n## Chapter 3\n### Asthara Chosen by the Angels\nNow in the land of [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) lived a Deshwarite priestess called Asthara, and her husband with her. And it came to pass that in the deep hours of the night, the sinless Angels sent a message in a dream to Asthara, saying, 'you shall have a daughter, and she will bring all of Deshwacath back to true faith. And you will call her name 'Yahna,' for she will be righteous amongst people.' And Asthara was deeply troubled by this, for she had not yet learned of true faith, and it was the custom that priests should not bear children.\n\nAnd so she knelt down in the temple, and brought her soul close to the Angels, asking, 'why have you charged me with motherhood? Do you not recognise my robes as those of a priestess?' and the angel Ceiris[^5], whom was the explainer, spoke out in an apparition, saying, 'Asthara, do not weep! For this is a great task you have been charged with. We see that your heart is good amongst people, and you have been chosen as the progenitor of the slayer of misfaith.' But Asthara was worried, saying, 'tell me you are lying, for I must not have devoted my life to misfaith.' and Ceiris said, 'yea, but it was not in vain. Your misfaith has laid the foundation for the new age of true faith.'\n### The Girl Rescued from the River Morassar\nAnd so Asthara left the temple, and was walking along the river Morassar[^6] to her home, when she saw a baby girl in the waters. And she was greatly surprised, and drew the girl out of the river, but the child was blue, and was not breathing, and so Asthara cast magic, pulling the water from her lungs, and the girl was revitalised. And Asthara asked, 'where are your parents, young girl? May the Angels rebuke whomever hurt you, O precious creation.' But the girl responded, 'I have no parents,' for she was an orphan. And she said, 'I was merely playing alone by the riverbank, and I fell in.' And so Asthara asked, 'do you have a home?' But the girl said, 'nay,' for she could not answer. And Asthara asked also, 'do you have a name?' but the girl could not answer also. And so Asthara took the girl's hand and walked the rest of the way home, and took the girl as her child, calling her 'Perrelim[^7],' for she did not know who she was.\n\nAnd it came to pass after many years that as Asthara laid down in her bed to sleep, Ceiris called out for her in a dream, saying, 'O good priestess! You believe that Perrelim is an ordinary girl, but you have seen that she is exceeding fair and good amongst the Deshwarites, and I tell you that she is in fact Yahna.' And Asthara awoke, and could not sleep, for she understood that the age of true faith was upon her, and she knelt down and said, 'I do not know if I can handle the responsibility.' And Ceiris responded from the heavens, 'be faithful and listen out for the truth from your daughter, and you will be preserved from fear in true understanding.'\n\n[^1]: Sarvaran '*qáyanith*,' meaning 'souls,' or 'pieces of tar,' (*qayą́* / *qayan-* + *-ith* `soul-PL`.)

If I had the means, surely, I would make the travel across Tseireph to our home, but grave events have ensured my continued residence in the hills of *Anqhïrs*. These will be explained in due time, and hopefully unchecked. I have intended to write to you for months ere now. I departed from you and our mother with such determination that I regrettably neglected to mention the reason for my flight. But I have continually read your letters with care and affection, yet without the time nor energy to write back—for all of these faults I am deeply sorry, my dear Milkweed, and I meant no alarm to you nor our mother. For my thoughts have been focussed almost wholly on the subject of my arrival here. That being the *Sharadith*. Those wretched creatures that have dwelt here since before you and I were but a thought in the minds of the Angels, how your heart must pound at their name! But it is not fear that drives me, but rather pity, for it has been my hypothesis that these creatures are not evil beasts, but rather curable men and women, ready to be made whole again, and their minds mended for the benefit of our imperial and holy Matriarchdom.\n\nThis flame within my mind was ignited by the venerable Priest Elkwort. It was during my studies at the grand temple that I learned of the intricacies of the Sharadith, beyond the tales our Mother told us. I was enchanted by the many things I read. How could these creatures enact such evil, without attracting the ire of the Child? Surely if any one of us unafflicted by the curse commited such evil transgressions as murder, or as exsanguination, we should be cast into the earth, and our entire being scattered within the meadows. And yet these detestable beings do such, and are not dealt with so justly. I believe this is for a reason. In the months I spent in the rooms of the temple, I read many scrolls in an endeavour to find this reason. Some of these scrolls were easy to understand, and yet these were worn by the hands of eager students like your brother, and their contents thus known by all who learn in those halls. The more igniting information was kept within those written in more archaic style, their contents obfuscated by the confusion of our tongue. And so I resolved to translate these texts.\n\nElkwort, knowing some of the ancient tongue as it pertains to the liturgy, was able to aid me in this matter. With his help, I was able to learn of the methods by which one might become a *Sharadh*, a process triggered by the consumption of the flesh or blood of a fellowperson. This dark truth shook me to my core as a fatal bell, ringing out upon a funeral, and at points I even considered abandoning my studies. And yet, as if by some unseen force, I was driven ever onward in my studies. I was struck by dreams, nay, nightmares, of what might happen were I to become a Sharadh, and what grave happenstance that would occur to facilitate this becoming. But it is best not to give heed to such thoughts, and the ever returning Sarvaran sunrise over the eastern horizon was fit to cast these apprehensions away into the ether. There was something of the east, even, that intruigued me, of the same species as this unseen force of motivation. Through further studies, it was proven to me by the ancient texts that the east certainly was the source of the Sharadith, that they make their origin in the hills of Anqhïrs, that wretched place in the south of the peninsula to our east. I thought, what significance does this location hold that I might be drawn there? It was now that I had made the decision to leave for Anqhïrs, if only I had made a proper goodbye to you and our mother! Maybe then I should die happy if I were to never see you again. But yet, the prelude to my departure was still some kind of goodbye, if gravely regrettable, and were I to do it all over, I would not have been so brief.\n\nI left for Anqhïrs by wooden carriage, led by a man known by no other name than Bergamot, a diminutive man who suffered from some kind of deformity, a commoner as we are, yet he is amongst the poor of our caste. This was a man who knew no kindness than his own, yet from entering his carriage I felt as if within the company of an old friend, and treated him well. He was delighted to recieve my kindness. I paid him not only with my good company, but also a generous amount of gold to convey me to the dark and fatal corners of Tseireph. It was difficult to tell if his happiness was owed to my generosity or rather his own heart, but it became clear to me that this man was counted amongst the kindest of people, and my heart ached with the knowledge of the place he was dealt within our society. On our journey, we picked up many fellow travellers, but most were surprised to know where I was headed, and weren't headed toward a like destination. Only two of these fleeting souls stayed with me for the remainder of our Journey, that being a priestess known as Hellebore, and a Corothic noblewoman known as Anise. O Milkweed, how I wish you could have met Anise! She shined not only with beauty but also with authority and wisdom. The priestess Hellebore was owed a similar amount of reverence, and yet we were reluctant to do so. She was a bitter woman in spite of her great and respectable service in our society, and following her arrival I found that the moments spent in her slumber were the brightest. However, I discovered that Hellebore came to Anqhïrs with a similar goal to your brother, that she sought to do many works concerning the Sharadith; but her goals differed from mine in that she wished to commune with the Child and the Angels to destroy them, and not cure them.\n\n%% I departed from Sarvara on a wooden carriage led by a diminutive servant man called Acorn, and his 6 draught animals, each with unique and peculiar deformities. It seemed as though the man choked on every word, forcing each sentence out with a cough.\n'To Anqhïrs, sir?' He asked.\n'Aye.'\n'I hear there's Sharadith there. It wouldn't be wise of me to take you without a fee.'\nMy contempt of the ugly man grew with this greedy proposition, but I was obliged to comply with his request, lest I forsake my unseen force, or lead this pitiful man into near-death without fitting payment.\n'Thank you sir, kind sir. I don't suppose you'll wish for any company, sir?' He replied. 'I'll pick up more passengers along the way, sir.'\n\nThe journey itself was that of over a month, and the presence of company was one I desired dearly. We stopped by cities in search of new passengers, but Acorn was laughed at by most, save for by some kind souls. By the midpoint of our journey, we had picked up a couple new friends. The first of the two was a Corothic tradeswoman named Apricot, and the second was a husband of a noble from a land unknown to me, named Bergamot.","lastmodified":"2024-12-21T23:03:00.476499967Z","tags":[]},"/writing/translations/the-north-wind-and-the-sun":{"title":"The North Wind and the Sun","content":"## Original Text\nThe North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.\n\nThey agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.\n\nThen the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him;\n\nand at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
