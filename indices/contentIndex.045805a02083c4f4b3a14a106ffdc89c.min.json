Common iris colours are maroon, brown, green, and dark mauve.\n\nIn addition, the colours of minikin sclerae are almost always white, but can also be light pink due to [Alucinarium](alucinara/alucinara.md) exposure.\n\n### Hair\nMinikin exhibit hair only on their heads, chins, tails, and pubic areas. They also feature whiskers on their top lips.\n\nHowever, as infants, they feature hair all over their bodies except for their fingers, toes, and face. After the first year, all of this hair is lost.\n\nMinikin hair colour can express itself as brown, beige, grey, ginger, or white.","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/murine":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-rat":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-snail":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-squirrel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-weasel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/rat":{"title":"Rat","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/rodent":{"title":"Rodent","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/sea-slug":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/silkgrub":{"title":"Silkgrub","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/slug":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/squirrel":{"title":"Squirrels","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/war-weasel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/weasel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-30T11:24:21.809178127Z","tags":null}}
