The tide hasn't returned to us in millenia, but we still see the ripples created by those whom travel across the pools. For instance, take a black hole - It could merely be a distortion in spacetime caused by the death of a star, but the activity of black holes is also known to coincide with supernatural sightings on Earth. It is my hypothesis that the tide is returning - and these events are the ripples created by those who enter our pool through the waves.  - Eugene W.
