These three elements come together to create a morellic garment.\n## Colour\nThere are many [dyes](materials/dyes.md) to choose from, all of which have different effects on different fabrics. Dyes are not used when tanning. Different dyes are used to create different feelings such as that of opulence, poverty, or occupation.\n## Material\nThere are three most common types of material used in clothing;\n- Firm\n- Elastic\n- Baggy\n### Firm\nFirm materials are those like tanned leaves, thick fabric, or leather. They are usually very firm, thick, dark, and are used in pieces such as the waist-belt and tunic. They are usually made out of animal hide, felt, or longleaf.\n### Elastic\nElastic material is self-explanatory; it is soft fabric that stretches. It is commonly used in places where stretching is common, such as the cuffs, waistband, and undershirt. They are commonly made out of fibres such as silk.\n### Baggy\nBaggy material is also fabric; it is generally pleated or draped over the body. They are generally created out of plant fibres such as flax or linen.\n## Shape\nThere are many shapes that are indicative of a morellic garment. These are:\n- Bell-shaped openings\n- Tunics or Capes that cross over themselves in an X shape over the chest area.\n- Shoes that protect the toes and wrap the rest of the foot in a spiral.\n### Tunic\nThe tunics on morellic clothing are characterised by their cross-shaped overlap placed over the chest. This not only gives customisability as for how much skin to show around the neck, but also creates a pleasing V-neck shaped design. The tunic is commonly made out of firm material.\n\nThis cross-shaped overlap is created by using a long piece of material which is draped over the shoulders, overlapped, and tucked into the waist-belt. Sometimes, some additions are made, such as;\n- Pins\n- Buttons\n- Straps\n- Laces\n#### Pins\nIn the case of pins, a circular or oblong pin is used to fasten the upper layer to the lower layer. These pins, similar to safety pins, are often decorated with cute pictures, [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), and designs, and help the overlap to stay in place. One to three is the usual amount of pins used.\n#### Buttons\nSimilar to pins, buttons are also decorated with symbols or pictures. They are sewn into the lower layer's side of the tunic,  and are fed into holes on the other side, in order to make sure that the overlap does not come undone.\n#### Straps\nThe use of straps is less common, but is standard for active, athletic, or bandit minikin. They are used with non-overlapped tunics, ones which do not have an X-shape but simply ride down the shoulders leaving a gap in between.\n\nStraps are used to customise the length of the gap. Keeping the V-neck design, they are used to bring the sides of the tunic together, leaving little to no gap. There is usually no more than 1 strap used, if any.\n#### Laces\nLaces are used in a similar way to straps, only using a string to tie the gap closed on non-overlapping tunics. The laces are often fed through multiple holes and are tied into intricate symbols or designs.\n### Waist-Belt\nThe waist belt is a ubiquitous aspect of morellic clothing. Their thickness can vary from thin to wide. Thin belts feature a buckle simply to do its job, but wider belts can feature symbols or designs on their buckles, such as metal engravings.\n\nWaist belts are commonly made out of leather or tanned leaves, are placed atop the waistband which the undershirt is tucked into. Sometimes, patterns are scored into the belts, such as concentric lines or diagonal repeating lines.\n### Undershirt\nThe undershirt is made up of two parts - the sleeves, and the body section. The undershirt is generally made out of elastic material and features a simple overlapping shape.\n\nThere is no gap in the centre of some undershirts, in which case the overlap is sewn into the bottom of the undershirt and buttons are optionally added. In undershirts with a gap, the gap is closed using lace, which also has many holes to be fed through and tied into intricate shapes.\n### Sleeves\nSleeves are the visible portion of the undershirt, and are made from baggy material. They may be short, or go down to the wrist; they are bell shaped, flaring with pleats which are sewn closed at the end of the sleeves. At the end, one may add a cuff, or may forgo this option. There are many cuff designs:\n- Tube Cuff\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### Tube Cuff\nThe tube cuff is named for its cylindrical shape. It is simply a tube attached to the end of the sleeve, close to skin-tight. They generally have two straps at their beginning and end to customise their circumference, although some only have one strap at the end.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff is similar to the tube cuff, only it doesn't go in a tube shape for does it stay close to the skin. Rather, it flares outward in a waving ruffled pattern. The length of this cuff can vary from short to very long in some cases, but it never exceeds past the hand when fit correctly.\n#### No Cuff\nNo cuff simply means that the sleeve ends when the pleats are sewn together, with no continuation. This option is uncommon for arm sleeves, and is usually taken when a cuff is too expensive to add; it is a cultural indicator of poverty.\n### Trousers\nTrousers can be calf-length or longer, but never end any further than the ankle. They are similarly bell-shaped with pleats, like sleeves, but have different customs for their waistband and cuffs.\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### No Cuff\nUnlike arm-sleeves, no cuffs on trousers is much less frowned upon. It is largely the norm for trousers.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff on trousers is always very short. It serves as a fashion decoration to demonstrate wealth or romantic favourability.\n#### Waistband\nIn addition, the waistband of morellic clothing is always very important. It is connected to the rest of the trousers, and is usually reinforced with a stretchy, elastic material. The undershirt is tucked into the trousers and the waist-belt is put atop the waistband, helping comfortability.\n### Shoes\nMorellic shoes are the most alien to humans. Due to their digitigrade feet, they feature small soles and long heels. Sometimes, shoes are simply not worn. The appearance of morellic shoes can vary from boots to glorified socks. There are two sections:\n- The toe section\n- The heel section\nSometimes, when the toe section is missed out, the heel section continues to the end of the foot, leaving the toes exposed, and a soft insole is tucked in between the soles and the fabric.\n#### Toe Section\nThe toe section has a firm dome that covers the upper side of the toes, and a hard underside that protects the soles from harm. Sometimes, the firm dome and hard underside are simply missed out; this is a sign of poverty. They are lined with a soft insole.\n#### Heel Section\nThe heel section is relatively simple, it is just a piece of fabric connected to the toe section that wraps around the heel as if it were a bandage. The heel section is often tucked into the trousers.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["minikin","morellic","clothing"]},"/cosmology/alucinara":{"title":"Alucinara Energy","content":"## Overview\nAlucinara, also known as magic, is a form of energy that alters the ways in which the natural world can operate. It does this by altering the laws of nature in its vacinity from the third laws of nature to the first.\n## Appearance\nThe energy lacks an appearance, but is physically contained within the crystalline element of Alucinarium. Alucinarium is dark purple and shines bright orange, emitting bright orange specks, orbs, and flashes of light when disturbed.\n## Origins\nAlucinara energy originates before the shattering of the realms, in the original first laws of nature created by the first Judge. When the realms were shattered by the spirits of darkness, the second judge enforced the third laws of nature, but created Alucinara energy as it is now, alloweding the first laws to operate in its presence.\n## Biology\nThe presence of Alucinara on living beings has many effects, such as the development of the fortuitary gland where alucinarium is excreted into the bloodstream for use, and the manipulation of evolution in unexpected and fantastical ways.\n### In Tandem with Darkness\nFurthermore, when present in tandem with the energy of [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md), the soul is created. Souls are spirits that cannot exist without a physical form, such as in every living being apart from deities (also known as the ancient, incorporeal spirits of darkness), and [the petrified child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md).\n## Uses\nIt can be used to overcome the physical world through processes such as levitation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, hydrokinesis, energy medicine, and prophecy. It can also be used to contact deities through processes such as astral projection, dreams, and visions.\n### Examples\nSarkitwara fruit use Alucinara energy to emit bright flashes of light when disturbed as a biological process and defence mechanism when unripe. Similarly, Sapient species use Alucinara energy for many things, including to cook food and manipulate objects from afar.\n## Cultural Significance\nAlucinara is heavily culturally significant to virtually all cultures outside of the 0th realm, due to its fantastical and strange effects, especially how it can be used to contact incorporeal spirits. It is used in the rituals of some Minikin cultures as a way of speaking to gods.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["alucinara","cosmology","featured"]},"/cosmology/creation-story":{"title":"The Story of Creation","content":"## Overview\nThe creation story of the universe is characterised by one main event - the shattering of the realms. The universe was created by the two Judges, and shattered by the spirits of darkness.\n### The Judges\nThe Judges, the First and the Second, were the original spirits to reside within the void at the beginning of time. The first judge existed to create matter and the laws of nature, and the second judge existed to keep physical order and advise the first judge, but neither could destroy what they had previously created.\n### Darkness, and Spirits of\nOut of jealousy for the first judge's power, the second judge created the second laws of nature, which were contained (and hidden) within the energy of Darkness, in an act of rebellion against its companion.\n\nHowever, the dynamics created in the intersection of the two systems would result in the emergence of the first souls, which were known as the spirits of darkness. The spirits of darkness had not only the power to destroy, but also the need to feed upon matter, or else they would die.\n### The Spirit of Goodness\nThe first judge swiftly found out about the second laws of nature, abhorring the existence of spirits meant to destroy the universe it had created with its companion. In order to govern the darkness, the first judge created the spirit of Goodness, which would slay the spirits, turning them into dust.\n### Shattering of the Realms\nDespite the efforts of the first judge and the spirit of goodness, the spirits of darkness eventually destroyed a good portion of the universe. And ultimately, the last things to destroy were the judges.\n\nIn their attempt to consume the first judge, the spirits of darkness triggered the shattering of the realms, an event so catastrophic that it not only destroyed the first judge, but also split the universe into innumerable separate realms.\n### The Third Laws of Nature\nThe second judge, consumed by regret and loneliness, decided to attempt to make the universe anew, and keep alive the tradition of its companion. It created the third laws of nature to govern every realm, but kept alive the second laws in the energy of Darkness, and the first laws in the energy of Alucinara.\n#### Darkness\nHowever, Darkness now required a physical form, which was Hydrocarbons. The only way in which the darkness could affect the world was by functioning as the soul of living beings, originating in the amino acids and organic compounds that are found in all carbon-based lifeforms. In the form of bitumen or tar, the darkness could exist, but not affect the world.\n##### Deities\nMost of the spirits of darkness were destroyed in the shattering, or trapped within the furthest realms, leading new souls to be created as life began to develop in the new realms. However, some of the spirits of darkness were powerful enough to not only survive but also shift into the central realms and exist incorporeally.\n\nThese spirits were only contactable by physical beings through dreams and the use of alucinara energy, and began to be revered as gods by some cultures. As gods, these spirits would perform favours and miracles in return for the prayers and sacrifices from those who followed them.\n\nThese gods ranged from good to evil, each having their own personality. The goodest tended to be the most humble, serving the realms in benevolent ways in return for nothing, and the worst tended to enjoy the reverence and praise they recieved, acting malevolently and only well to those who commited acts of evil for them.\n#### Alucinara\nLikewise, Alucinara similarly required a physical form, which was Alucinarium. Alucinarium affected the world at all times, constantly enforcing the first laws within its vicinity. Eventually, most (excluding the living beings of the 0th realm) living beings would use alucinara energy in some way or other, as a tool or biological process.\n#### The Spirit of Goodness\nThe spirit of goodness' physical form was that of stone; Anywhere there was exposed stone, the spirit of goodness would be able to see and affect the world. The most common manifestation of the spirit of goodness was [The Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md), but [Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) were the second most common.\n\nThe Petrified Child's objective, given by the second judge, was to govern the evil (rather than disorder) commited by living beings by turning all evil beings into an extremely fertile substance known as Baby Sludge, which would trigger the proliferation of lush wildlife, but was incredibly dangerous to touch.\n\nAs punishment for it's failure to protect the old universe from disorder, it was given the mind and image of a swaddled child, forever cursed to lack maturity and worldliness, and forever cursed to be imprisoned within a body of stone.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["cosmology","lore"]},"/cosmology/darkness":{"title":"Darkness","content":"## Overview\nDarkness, similar to Alucinara, is a form of energy that forms the foundation of the Soul.

It accomplishes this through the use of [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) and the turning of evildoers into baby meadows.\n\nIt was initially created as the Spirit of Goodness before the shattering of a realms, but was given the mind and image of a child once the third laws of nature were created, which required virtually all spirits to have a physical form.\n## Appearance\n![](images/the-petrified-child.png)\n\nThe Petrified Child has the appearance of a swaddled infant, and is approximately 5 metres in length. It has the body of a bean-like inverse teardrop, a surface texture of shifting, looped ridges, and a round face on the front of its upper half. \n\nIt is made of solid stone, composed of many mineral or mineraloid compounds, and has [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md) eyes with a deep purple sclera and glowing orange iris. Its rock type cannot be determined, as it was not formed but rather manifested upon the shattering of the realms.\n\nIts face takes many forms, often shifting depending on who the Petrified Child is facing. For example, to the [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md), it appears with the face of a minikin child, and to the [demi-slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md), the face of a demi-slug child.\n\nDuring the reign of the Empire of the Petrified Child, it was commonly depicted with the face of an owl, owing to the animalistic masks worn in Stonechild Imperial society.\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of the Petrified Child is to destroy evil where it may arise. The term 'evil' is not a term defined in the petrified child's mind, as to allow for a case-by-case conclusion on wether or not an offender needs to be destroyed.\n\nThe method by which the petrified child destroys is by disintegrating all but the offender's skeleton into an organic fertiliser known as 'Baby Sludge,' an alucinariferous substance far more conducive to plant growth and ecosystemic health than other fertilisers, due to its inherent volume of nutrients as well as magic influence.\n\n### Baby Meadows\nA 'Baby Meadow' is the term for the resulting oasis-like region that arises after baby sludge becomes incorporated into the earth. Following the destruction of evil, a baby meadow goes through three stages;\n\n#### Stage 1\nFollowing disintegration, the baby sludge settles on the ground and is partly absorbed into the soil. Little ecosystemic proliferation takes place in this stage, as the baby sludge is so severe that any flora or fauna in the vicinity will suffer from fungal or bacterial infection upon coming in contact with it.\n\nThis stage features mass ecological decline in the immediate area; the outward appearance of a baby meadow at this stage is that of a flat plain with a skeleton at its centre and decomposing trees, shrubbery, and animals scattered about.\n\n#### Stage 2\nThis is the stage at which the immediate danger has subsided, and nature begins to reclaim the area with greater ferocity than before. Alongside the proliferation of the local greenery, animals from other habitats may migrate to the area to feed upon the new food sources brought with the ecosystemic growth, especially if they are collecting food for hibernation.\n\nAlongside this appearance of new herbivorous fauna, predatory animals will similarly frequent the area in search of prey. Some predators, having smelled the appearance of baby sludge, will have shed their normal coats of fur over the first stage in favour of a coat of better camouflage, hiding in the brush until a prey animal walks by.\n\nThe appearance of this stage is similarly plain like the previous stage, but it otherwise features the proliferation of dense fruiting, blooming shrubbery, and the appearance of animals arriving to feed. At this point, moss, lichen, and vines will have begun growing on the skeletal remains, resulting in a characteristic green shade to the bones with blossoms growing from the surface.\n\n#### Stage 3\nThe final stage is the least dangerous relative to the previous stages, featuring little danger and little predators than wouldn't usually be expected. By this point, the ecosystemic proliferation will have ceased, and the health of the flora will sustain itself in the natural cycle of nutrients into plants and back into the ground.\n\nAt this point, the central skeleton may have rotted and crumbled, serving as fertiliser in and of itself, or it will have stayed standing in the case of stronger skeletons. The appearance of this stage is marked by the appearance of tall green trees; if the skeleton hasn't disappeared it will surely be hidden by the lush trees which will have grown in the area.\n\nFrom here on, the area will stay relatively constant in state, featuring dense flora. Over time the region may be overcome with other flora, resembling a baby meadow less and less after the initial propagation declines, but this is a very slow process due to the influence of Alucinara in the area following the dissemination of baby sludge.\n\n## Detection of Evil\nThe petrified child detects evil through 'eyes' scattered across the realms. A fair proportion of these eyes exist naturally, but the majority of these eyes were carved by the [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) and [Stonechild](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md) minikin, after it was discovered they could be created manually.\n\n'Eyes' are rock formations given use by their physical resemblance to eyes or faces. They were discovered by an early [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) group of minikin who realised that the petrified child came to save them from danger only when there was a nearby cliff face or boulder with eyes formed into the surface.\n\nThe formation of these eyes is greatly helped by Alucinarium content in the rock, as this often causes the surface to shift into the shape of a face. This is often hastened by the process of erosion.\n\n### Watchstones\nOnce the morellic minikin had discovered this, they began to seek out rocks and carve faces into them, commonly as a good luck charm. These came to be known as '[Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md).'\n\nA lot of these rocks would be ineffective as they would be hidden away in a pocket, unable to see out of the fabric. So, the morellic minikin would sometimes cut holes in their pockets so that the eyes could see out.\n\nAn innovation came when early-stonechild minikin discovered that carving alucinarium geodes into watchstones worked to allow them to move, tremendously increasing the field of view of the watchstones.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["cosmology","petrified-child","featured"]},"/history/early-minikin-history":{"title":"Early History of the Minikin","content":"![](images/map_of_2nd_realm.png)\n## Timeline\n### 5 MYA\n- Minikin begin to diverge from the lineage that would become red squirrels\n- Minikin ancestors are shifted from the 0th realm to the 2nd due to supernova\n### 3 MYA\n - The genus Anthrosciurus diverges from Sciurus\n - Anthrosciurids begin to use tools\n### 1 MYA\n- Anthrosciurids begin to use fire and [magic](cosmology/alucinara.md)\n- Language is developed in Anthrosciurids\n### 300,000 YA\n- Early Minikin evolve into Modern Minikin (Anthrosciurus arborensis) in northern [Tséireph](locations/tseireph.md)\n### 200,00 YA\n- First wave of minikin migration takes place\n- Ancestors of Eastern Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis occidentalis) migrate to the eastern continent and eastern islands\n- Modern Minikin spread across whole of Tséireph\n### 175,000 YA\n - Second wave of minikin migration takes place\n - Ancestors of Southern Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis australis) migrate to southwestern continent\n### 50,000 YA\n - Third and final wave of minikin migration takes place\n - Ancestors of Insular Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis insulensis) diverge from Southern Minikin and continue to migrate south to the southwestern archipelago\n - The various Minikin subspecies begin to spread and cohabitate with other races\n### 10,000 YA\n- Agriculture begins to be practised by Minikin, originating in fluvial areas with seasonal floods in Mediterranean climates.\n\t- In the region of the [Sarvaran river basin](locations/sarvaran-basin.md), in the southern half of Tséireph\n\t- In the region of Kossüka, in the northern half of Tséireph\n\t- In the region of Weikahn, in the eastern continent\n### 9000 YA\n- Various plants and animals began to be domesticated\n- Minikin began to wear clothing made out of Lunuth fibre, Oomi silk, and Treegoat fur, dyed with pigments derived from various berries, trees, insects, and fungi\n- The first proto-cities were founded\n## Further Reading\n- [Sarvaran history](history/morellic-history.md)","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["minikin","lore","featured"]},"/history/morellic-history":{"title":"History of the Morellic Minikin","content":"## Overview\nThe Morellic race is a race of minikin descending from the Sarvaran, Aqhoran, and Corothic cultures. These cultures were forager nomads from the west, north, and east, who settled in the Sarvaran river basin due to it's highly fertile soil and the Mora river's seasonal flooding.\n### Dyes and Colours\nThe main colours of the three tribes are Red for the Aqhorans, Orange for the Sarvarans, and Yellow for the Corothic Minikin. These stem from the most abundant dyes in each area, being Aqhoran Red (originating from nyutaberry roots), Sarvaran Orange (originating from dhajar tree bark), and Corothic Yellow (originating from Corothic turmeric rhizomes).\n## Timeline\n### 9000 YA\n9000 years ago, the Sarvaran, Aqhoran, and Corothic minikin settled in the Sarvaran river basin, and by this time Minikin everywhere had begun to use stone tools for centures.\n\nThese three groups, who later intermingled and from which emerged the Morellic culture, were all nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes who would eventually settle down in the area, reaching differing levels of sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThis period was a time of great development, as these Minikin groups all began to utilise clay to build shelters and furnaces, and utilise fire or [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) magic to cook food and smelt ore.\n\nFurthermore, another great development was the shift toward nomadic pastoralism with the emergence of domestication, when these minikin groups began to keep animals such as wooly hogs, snoutgoats, and pygmy bushdeer.\n### 8500 YA\nIt was 8500 years ago that the first proto-cities in southern Tséireph were founded, and minikin began to create bronze tools.\n\n\u003e [!quote] I made this knife out of bronze.\n\u003e **Old Sarvaran:**\n\u003e san mu tcoyar derênim kel übêliwâ\n\u003e \t`1 this knife tin-copper out_of make_PST`\n\u003e \t`san mu t͡ʃo.jar d̪e.reː.nim kel y.beː.li.waː`\n\u003e \n\u003e **Sarvaran:**\n\u003e mú tcoyár deréinų̈ yokél sammúyübéiliwa\n\u003e \t`this knife bronze 3.PLNT-out_of 1-3-3.PLNT-make-PST`\n\u003e \t`ˈmú t͡ʃoˈjár d̪eˈrẽ́ĩ̯.nỹ joˈkél sɐ̃ˈmːú.jʏˈbéi̯.lɪ.wa`\n#### Aqhor\nAqhor, a port settlement, was the most advanced of the proto-cities to arise in the river basin, and was where the name of the Aqhoran minikin originates. It was here that agriculture began to be practiced for the first time, as the Aqhoran minikin would farm crops such as Aqhoran rice and Lunuth wheat.\n#### Sarvara\nSarvara was a Morellic proto-city, founded inland on the Mora river. Sarvara showed a trend consistent with future Morellic communities, the inhabitation of the canopy, where clay shelters, walkways, and other structures were built on the branches of Red Dhakar trees.\n\nSarvara benefitted from the seasonal flooding of the Mora river, but lacked in agricultural prowess, owing to the Sarvaran minikin's preferrence for hunter-gathering. However, arboreal foraging gave them a natural access point to the farming of various species, such as Nyutaberries, Sarkitwara, and Oomi silkworms.\n\nThe Sarvaran minikin would create tools for cutting and hunting, using sharp blades to safely cut fruit off their branches and rudimentary bows and arrows to hunt animals such as rat monkeys and defend themselves against the predatory pygmy widrens in the area.\n#### Coroth\nCoroth was a Corothic proto-city.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.675932293Z","tags":["minikin","morellic","sarvara","aqhor","coroth","lore"]},"/locations/morellic-place-namebase":{"title":"Proto-Morellic Place Namebase","content":"- serewęth \u003c\u003c\u003c sele-vent\n- mïrnisem \u003c\u003c\u003c mïzni-semu\n- skerasem \u003c\u003c\u003c skela-semu\n- yerekh murį \u003c\u003c\u003c ghezek muzin\n- sikauberą \u003c\u003c\u003c sikûbe-zan\n- belonarą \u003c\u003c\u003c belhona-zan\n- tsünrok murį \u003c\u003c\u003c tsünzoka muzin\n- anudhrą \u003c\u003c\u003c anudh-zan\n- darwidh \u003c\u003c\u003c dazvida\n- illirą \u003c\u003c\u003c ilyi-zan\n- anwakirą - anhvaki-zan\n- tïrissem \u003c\u003c\u003c tïnlis-semu\n- skerivadh \u003c\u003c\u003c skezi-bhadu\n- odwamegh \u003c\u003c\u003c odvam-ega\n- stïreisem \u003c\u003c\u003c stïlâ-semu\n- draupïną \u003c\u003c\u003c dzûpïnan\n- arasam murį \u003c\u003c\u003c alasamh muzin\n- kürąpenoi \u003c\u003c\u003c küzan-penoya\n- errïkaurą \u003c\u003c\u003c ellikû-zan\n- üsmirith \u003c\u003c\u003c üsmil-itu\n- nünukh murį \u003c\u003c\u003c nünuk muzin\n- avedhra \u003c\u003c\u003c abhedh-zan\n- awamoko \u003c\u003c\u003c avam-okon\n- sutwarath \u003c\u003c\u003c sutva-alati\n- ouka murį \u003c\u003c\u003c ôka muzin\n- araveisem \u003c\u003c\u003c alabhê-semu\n- ospara \u003c\u003c\u003c ospa-zan\n- wilasem \u003c\u003c\u003c vila-semu\n- nikarabh \u003c\u003c\u003c nikazab\n- khanarau muri \u003c\u003c\u003c hanalû muzin\n- dhükesem \u003c\u003c\u003c dhüken-semu\n- rawalutira \u003c\u003c\u003c zawa-lhuti-zan\n- sekayürunith \u003c\u003c\u003c seka-ghülun-itu\n- owi mutasi \u003c\u003c\u003c ovin mhu-tasin\n- kemaghra \u003c\u003c\u003c kemag-zan\n- arkïtsara \u003c\u003c\u003c alkïtsa-zan\n- lutïpunukra \u003c\u003c\u003c lhutï-punuk-zan\n- daurikeira \u003c\u003c\u003c dûlikân-zan\n- waitakuph murį \u003c\u003c\u003c vîtan-kupa muzin\n- dhaukir \u003c\u003c\u003c dhûkil\n- kabikon murį \u003c\u003c\u003c kambikonh muzin\n- seresem \u003c\u003c\u003c sele-semu\n- akuphra \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c akup-zan\n- norüc murį \u003c\u003c\u003c nolüsya muzin\n- akuppadra \u003c\u003c\u003c akuppad-zan\n- mülu \u003c\u003c\u003c mülhun\n- erüskorel \u003c\u003c\u003c ezüs-kozelh\n- lutalukh \u003c\u003c\u003c lütanluk\n- ksabira \u003c\u003c\u003c ksabi-zan\n- kalayemira \u003c\u003c\u003c kalan-ghemi-zan\n- dhesekera \u003c\u003c\u003c dhesenke-zan\n- eyumesai murį \u003c\u003c\u003c eghum-esî muzin\n- akulubh \u003c\u003c\u003c akulhuba\n- üskura \u003c\u003c\u003c üsku-zan","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["morellic","namebase"]},"/locations/sarvaran-basin":{"title":"The Sarvaran River Basin","content":"## Overview\nThe Sarvaran river basin is a river basin on the southern coast of [Tséireph](locations/tseireph.md).

They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of Alucinara, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.\n\nThey can pose a violent threat, as their crystalline claws or teeth can cause lacerations, infection, and a risk of phantasmarrhoea if a shard of alucinarium were to break off in the wound.\n\n![Cloud Gnat](images/cloud-gnat.png)\n\n## Appearance\nCloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty and purple, with an average length of 22cm. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain Alucinara and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/phenomena/enchantment":{"title":"Enchantment","content":"## Overview\nEnchantment is the term given to the presence of the [First Laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) in a being or item's behaviour. This means that if a being or object is enchanted, it will act strangely, in predictable or unpredictable ways depending on the specific enchantment.\n## Charms and Curses\nDifferent enchantments are divided into two categories, charms and curses. **Charms** are named for their beneficial effects, and **Curses** are named for their detrimental effects.\n### Example: Levitation\nLevitation, for instance, is often termed a charm. This is because levitation provides a convenient effect.\n\nFor example, it allows for the presence of floating stepping stones to connect arboreal walkways, or airships which can carry passengers. In these cases, levitation would be called the Charm of Levitation.\n\nLevitation can also be termed a curse, especially when it is employed on another living being. Levitation can allow one to fly, but it can also allow one to cause another to float against their will. In this case, levitation would be called the Curse of Levitation.\n## Method\nEnchantments can be cast through a variety of means. One method is through [Symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), designs traced into alucinara-rich surfaces to create a specific effect. Another, more common, method is through [spell-casting](phenomena/spell-casting.md).\n### Symbols\nUsing symbols, one can cast a long-lived enchantment. Symbols can enforce enchantments for days on end, until the surface they are traced into runs out of [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md).\n\nFor example, the design of a raindrop (or other wet thing) can be traced into a tree nearby a farm, and this would enforce the Charm of Rain, meaning that crops could be watered during a drought or famine.\n### Spell-casting\nUsing the casting of spells can create more short-lived fleeting enchantments, which only continue for as long as the sorcerer wants them to, or until their Alucinara reserve depletes.\n\nFor example, a sorcerer could outstretch their hand and force pebbles to fly at high speeds toward an aggressor, causing a short-lived expression of the Charm of Acceleration, a charm used to move objects (similar to the Charm of Levitation).","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["enchantment","phenomena","featured"]},"/phenomena/fortuitary-gland":{"title":"Fortuitary Gland","content":"## Overview\nFortuitary glands are glands dedicated to the secretion of [Alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md), and are integral to the use of Alucinara in biological processes or tools.\n\nIn [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md), they are small, two of them situated underneath the eyes, behind the back of the throat.

They often feature self-sustaining ecosystems atop them, with a forest or grassland on the topside, and a rocky underside which changes shape due to [Alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) influence.\n\n## Appearance\n### Topside\nThe topside of sky islands can vary in appearance, but appear rocky like the underside and dusty without outside influence. However, over time or if the island comes from an organic area, nature and claim the topside of sky islands and forests or grasslands can grow on top.\n\n### Underside\nThe underside of sky islands varies from the topside, commonly featuring only as a rocky surface. If a sky island is claimed by a sapient organism, the underside may be carved into and made to feature walkways or rooms carved into the rockface. However, when the surface is undisturbed, the alucinarium content causes the rock to warp or shift into shapes.\n\n## Formation\nSky islands begin as subterranean alucinarium deposits near the ground surface. The alucinarium eventually may cause the surrounding area to detach from the crust and begin to float.\n\nThe alucinarium content in the rock causes the surface of sky islands to change shape, warping into features such as a face, a carving of a scene, or other small-scale features. In addition, larger-scale features can develop, such as the overall shape of the sky island to warp into the body plan of an animal.\n\nFurthermore, sky islands show a tendancy to take the form animals according to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md). As sky islands float, they may take the form of avian animals such as birds or bats, or may take the form of aquatic animals such as whales or fish.\n\n## Feeding Habits\nWhile sky islands aren't alive, they need to be fed with Alucinara to stay afloat, and hunt alucinariferous animals or plants to refuel according to the pseudo-fauna principle.\n\nA common hunting practice is that the sky islands may be drawn to areas of high-alucinarium content, such as communities of animals or crystalline mountains. They swoop from high altitude  down, and catch any sources of Alucinara in their mouths which shift open as they descend.\n\nIf an animal is eaten, then the alucinarium present in their body will be absorbed into the rock as decomposition takes place. Once all that is left is bone, the bone will be naturally moved deeper into the rock itself as the stone shifts. This can cause high concentrations of calcium in the rock, and this can cause vast large stalagtites of calcium carbonate to form.\n\n## Stalagtites\nThese stalagtites hang from the underside of the sky islands, reaching large sizes. Due to the pseudo-fauna principle, these stalagtites may even warp vaguely into a shape reminiscent of a minikin, an other animal, or trees.\n\n### Spikefalls\nOnce the stalagtites reach a large enough size, they can fall from the sky islands in an event known as a Spikefall. Due to their large mass, wide, dusty, vast craters form once they reach the ground. While a lot of the stalagtite is vapourised on impact, the large scale of them can lead to the more stable inner rock staying intact.\n\nThe more stable rock tends to take a more clarified shape of what the stalagtites were before impact. Whereas a minikinoid stalagtite may have a smooth indistinct surface on the sky island itself, once fallen the exess is broken away and there is left colossal structures at the centre of each crater.\n\n### Stalagtite Communities\nIf found, some craters are converted into communities, cities, or towns. The central structure is commonly the basis of a deity, and these fallen stalagtites are often worshipped by those who live around them.\n\nIn addition, some crater communities carve houses or structures into the fallen stalagtites, creating walkways through the stone and balconies at the side, while others create wooden or clay buildings around the main structure. Some communities do both, and create walkways and/or connections from the carved structures into the external ones.\n\n#### Notable Stalagtite Communities\n- [Cratertown](locations/cratertown.md), a town inhabited by [Dviri](cultures/dviri.md) minikin, built around an indistinct-shaped stalagtite.\n- [City of the Fallen One](locations/city-of-the-fallen-one.md), a religious site of the [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí.md) minikin, built around a minikinoid stalagtite.\n- [Amanitaville](locations/amanitaville.md), the capital of [Morelland](locations/morelland.md), built around a mushroom-shaped stalagtite.\n\n### Notable Sky Islands\n- The Birds,\n\t- Aderyn Major, the largest sky island to record\n\t- and Aderyn Minor;\n- The Bats,\n\t- Ystlum Primus,\n\t- Ystlum Secundus, the most bloodthirsty sky island to record\n\t- and Ystlum Tertius;\n- The Whales,\n\t- Morvilog Major\n\t- and Morvilog Minor, the most peaceful sky island to record;\n- and The Worms,\n\t- Abwyd Primus, the longest sky island to record,\n\t- Abwyd Secundus,\n\t- Abwyd Tertius, the smallest sky island to record\n\t- and Abwyd Quartus.\n\n#### Aderyn Major\nAderyn Major, the largest sky island to record, takes the shape of a bird and has been inhabited by the Nesi and Stonechild Imperial Minikin. Originating from Tseiréph, Aderyn Major has been found and colonised by many central continent peoples.\n\n##### Discovery by the Ǫzí Minikin\nOnce, Aderyn Major crash-landed, having ran out of Alucinara. A group of minikin known as the Ǫzí minikin found Aderyn Major's remains and began to inspect it but, in a turn of tragic fate, one group of minikin entered the mouth of the sky island and tragically died to the ravenous ecosystem inside.\n\nWhen the alucinarium inside of the victims' bodies was released, the sky island took full advantage of this - immediately springing to animation, with the rest of the Ǫzí minikin on its back. It soon began to float upward, taking its place as the home of the Nesi Minikin, who broke off from the Ǫzí.\n\n##### Conquest by the Empire of the Petrified Child\nCenturies later, by the time of the Stonechild Era, the empire had begun to take advantage of their new technology of Alucinara-powered flight. Using an airship of theirs, they attacked the island - burning and pillaging the town of Aderynville and taking control of Birton, claiming it as the capital of their Aderyn Major Province.\n\nFollowing the conquest, two social classes formed, as is usual with stonechild colonialism - the Blue class and the Orange class. The blue class was named for the stonechild officers' blue attire, and the orange class for the remaining Nesi minikin's orange attire.\n\nFor centuries going forward, the Empire of the Petrified Child would control the island, policing entry and exit, taxing the inhabitants, converting them to [Stonechildism](religions/stonechildism.md), and mistreating them. However, once the empire fell, outside resources were scarce - the blues attempted to keep control, convincing themselves that the empire couldn't *truly* be gone, but it was too late.\n\n##### Fall of the Empire\nEventually, the blues formed their own state, not letting themselves succumb to the mounting resistence that was ready to burst in the wake of the political instability of the time. This was what would be known as the [True Sovereign State of Aderyn Major of the Petrified Child](locations/the-aderyn-state.md), often shortened to just 'The Aderyn State.'\n\nA queen was appointed of the highest-ranking officer of the island, beginning a matrilineal line of succession as each generation took the mantle of controlling the island.\n\nAs time went on, the unrest of the island calmed, as the blues became more and more comfortable with feeding dissenters to the belly of the island. However - stonechild influence on the island dimished over time, albeit slowly over centuries.\n\n##### Rise of the Nesi Minikin\nOver time, the class divide grew to become a mere suggestion.

They are rocks with eyes or faces carved into them, commonly made from [Alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md) geodes. They served as one of the first examples of mass-production by the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md).\n\nWatchstones with the ability to move imprint on the closest animal, observing to see if the animal carries out an evil action or an evil action is carried out against it.

This is the mechanism which the petrified child uses to detect evil.\n\nBefore watchstones began to be carved out of geodes, they were motionless and static despite their effectiveness. This meant a lot of watchstones would be hidden away in pockets as a good luck charm, but this proved ineffective. This led to the cutting of holes into pockets and the specific fabrication of places such as lockets and cases to place watchstones within; this allowed watchstones to serve their purpose more effectively.\n\nThey are often given other facial features in addition to their eyes, this practice began as artistic chiselling by the sarvaran minikin but eventually proved to increase the effectiveness and field of view of watchstones, becoming the standard by the time of the Empire of the petrified child.\n\n## Appearance\nWatchstones have the appearance of a chiselled pair of eyes / a face upon a hard rock or pebble. When carved from alucinarium geodes, watchstones can additionally feature an internal orange glow visible from the thinner parts of the surface.\n\nIn addition, they can feature physically separate 'legs' used to aid the process of floatation; large rocks or geodes form the main bodies of watchstones, and smaller alucinariferous pebbles form the legs.\n\n### Legs\nThese legs are made of pebbles taken from the ground, continually picked up with magic and put down when their inherent Alucinara has been used up. They aid the process of floatation in that, being in contact with the ground, they can act as leverage against the force of gravity. This means that less Alucinara is used up by the watchstone, and continuous floatation is sustainable.\n\n### Pebbles\nPebbles continually accumulate alucinarium over time due to Alucinara present in the air, and lose their Alucinara when in use by watchstones. This is why legs are discarded and fall over after a period of use, and why new ones are naturally picked up.\n\nIn some areas, the amount of energy is negligible, but in others - such as next to a crystalline alucinarium deposit - pebbles can become greatly saturated with the mineral to the point of geode formation; they are taken as legs at the mid-point of this process.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["petrified-child","pseudo-fauna","symbol","featured"]},"/religion/auruk-religion":{"title":"Aurűk Religion","content":"# Deities\nThe Aurűk's primary deity was the Petrified Child; a figure they termed Stéyą.

They are descended from the European Red Squirrel, with a lifespan of 12-18 years, reaching maturity around 8 years of age.\n\nThey and grew to become the most populous intelligent race of the 2nd Realm, and are capable of speech, agriculture, forming civilisations, among all of the other skills and industries that come with them.\n### Appearance\nThey are about 25-35cm in height, and are largely hairless besides their tails, noses, hands, and feet when mature, losing during adolescence the furry coats they are born with.\n### Sociology\nEarly Minikin groups were nomadic foragers and hunter-gatherers, living in familial clans which were united in tribes, united in cultures, united in races. Later Minikin groups settled down in arboreal cities, forming city states and, even later, nation states.\n### Diet\nMinikin are mostly herbivores, consuming fruits, nuts, leaves, vegetables, and treebark. Due to other forces, such as the development of cooking technology or food scarcity, Minikin also eat various forms of bread such as Lunuth bread, dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, and alcoholic drinks such as beer and fruit wine.\n## Bushdeer\n[Bushdeer](species/fauna/bushdeer.md) are a ruminant species native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They are related to Earth deer, with the major differences being their tree-like antlers, distinct white stripes on their sides, and skull-like white markings on their faces.\n### Diet\nBushdeer are herbivorous, their main source of food being leaves and moss. They sometimes eat other foods, such as algae, fungi, and small animals.\n### Antlers\nTheir antlers, their most striking feature, exhibit robust, vascularised, green pseudo-leaves; these leaves contain chloroplasts taken from the various photosynthetic organisms in the bushdeer's diets, and provide the animal with an extra source of energy.\n### Play-Dead Reflex\nWhen bushdeer undergo the instinctual play-dead reflex, the rib-like stripes and skull-like facial markings help to mask their bodies from predators, giving the impression that they have already been fully scavenged and begun to rot.\n## Pygmy Bushdeer\nPygmy bushdeer are a part-arboreal, smaller version of common bushdeer. They are venerated by the Morellic minikin as sacred animals, and are thus forbidden to be killed in Morellic culture.\n### Use\nThey are used as mounts by some Minikin cultures, including the Morellic, who ride them during religious ceremonies and pilgrimages. Other nomadic cultures ride them to find new areas for their livestock to graze.\n## Wooly Hogs\nWooly hogs are a species native to the 2nd realm which are related to, and resemble, the wild boars of earth. They are small and farmed for their wool and pork.\n### Appearance\nThey are about 25 cm in height when mature, but are proportionately bulky. They feature a large, long head, humped shoulders, small hind end, short legs, and characteristic long, curly fur.\n### Use\nThey are farmed by some Minikin cultures for their robust wool and nutricious pork, and are sometimes ridden or yoked. In order to remove parasites from their flesh, they are cooked, and it is considered taboo to eat their pork raw.\n\nAmong Morellic hunter minikin, it is said that it is good luck to cleanly cut a wild Wooly Hog's tail off, and bad luck to fail to do this. These tails are often kept as trophies by hunters, and appear in heraldry as a symbol of good skill.\n## Snoutgoats\n\n### Snoutgoat Ivory\n\n### Snoutgoat Leather\n\n## Rat Monkeys\nRat monkeys are an arboreal monkey species native to the 2nd and -1st realms, the only monkey species native to Tséireph below the equatorial rainforest. They are small, similar to squirrels in size and habitat, and eat nuts, leaves, and various small animals. They are hunted by some Minikin cultures, such as the early Sarvaran minikin.\n## Pack Snails\nPack snails are a gastropod species native to the 2nd realm. They are large, about the same height as Minikin from their foot to the top of their shells. Their diet consists of leaves and vegetables.\n### Use\nThey are used by some Minikin cultures to transport goods such as spices and grains, in which case their shells are fitted with a saddle and utility belts featuring tools and cargo pouches, travelling in often guarded caravans headed by merchants.\n## Dragon Salamanders\n\n### Water Dragons\n\n### Leaf Dragons\n\n### Rock Dragons\n\n### Quartz Dragons\n\n## Widrens\n\n## Darkmoths\n\n## Oomi Silkworms\n\n## Weasels\n\n### Cavalry Weasels\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["fauna","2nd realm"]},"/species/fauna/bushdeer":{"title":"Bushdeer","content":"## Overview\nBushdeer (Type Species spp. *Floricervus Floricervus*), native to the steppes of the 2nd and -1st realms, are a type of deer related to the Sika deer of Earth. They are herbivores and browsers, consuming leaves and moss. The most striking difference is their antlers, which feature 'leaves.'\n## Origins\nAt first, the descendents of Sika deer which had undergone essential shift began to experience swift evolution due to the effects of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) on their bodies. One of these changes was the development of folate, vascularised protrusions on their antlers.\n\nThese 'leaves' initially served as areas for heat exchange in the steppes. However, due to the increased consumption of photosynthetic organisms aided by the new ecosystem they had found themselves in, these 'leaves' began to also serve as dumps for chlorophytes, which the deer couldn't metabolise.\n## Appearance\nBushdeer appear brown, white, and black. Their leaves can vary from green to yellow to pink depending on their diets. Their sides are painted with long, white, vertical streaks, reselving ribs, and their tops feature dappled white spots.\n## Behaviour\nWhen under threat, they undergo the reflex to go limp and play dead. This is aided by their ribcage-esque fur patterns, which make them appear to be rotting and already scavenged.\n## Cultural Significance\nThe arboreal bushdeer (spp. *Floricervus arborealis*), a dwarfish relative to the common bushdeer native to the forests of Tséireph, is seen as sacred by the Morellic minikin, who collect their antlers when they are dropped. These antlers are generally put on display or ground into a powder for medicinal purposes.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["fauna","deer"]},"/species/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDemi-Slugs (spp. *Arion homunculus*) are a nomadic sapient gastropod species native to the 1st realm. They are herbivores, eating leaves and soft plant tissue. They live in societies built around the ceremonial and survivalistic foraging of plants and defense from other animals.\n\n## Adaptations\nAfter the Supernova of 80MB, a great portion of slugs were shifted into the 1st realm. These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with Alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to alucinarium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["species","fauna","slug"]},"/species/fauna/djidjit":{"title":"Djidjit","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["species","fauna","skipper"]},"/species/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDragons, native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), are a small amphibian species capable of flight.

To the [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin.md) minikin, ikpliks are treated as both pets and livestock; sheared for their wool, skinned for their pelt, and used to enrich farm soil.\n\nThey are rarely eaten by all races but the [austerkin](groups/austerkin) as their diet results in the accumulation of toxins in their flesh.

They are arboreal omnivores which tend toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They are capable of language, and appear anthropoid.\n\n## Adaptation\nMany red squirrels that had found themselves in the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md) as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and are subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;\n- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,\n- greater agility and capacity for stealth,\n- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.\n\n## Morphology\nMinikin measure at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same Alucinara that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Morellic Race\n\n### Austerkin Race\nThe Austerkin are a lot hairier compared to other minikin races.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution can vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tends to have hair, and the tail is fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin are almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin are hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour can vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour can vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tend to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's den(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or dens.\n\nModern minikin groups inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees are often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commits a crime, they are ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails are seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and disconnection from the soul is representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' can vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group is too large for one community, it inevitably collapses. A varying amount of groups form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups are often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucinarium secretion and essential shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, are greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernate in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin become unconscious in a sleep-like state, and alucinarium levels in the brain increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protect the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis is not seen in normal sleep, but is shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucinarium in the brain during hibernation is a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["species","fauna","rodent","featured"]},"/species/fauna/snails":{"title":"snails","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/2e-flora":{"title":"Flora of the Second Realm","content":"## Nyuta Bushes\nNyuta bushes are a type of bush native to the 2nd and 1st realms.

They are foraged by some Minikin cultures.\n### Nyuta Tea\nNyuta tea is favoured for its hallucinogenic effects when consumed in large quantities, leading the drink to have a lot of spiritual significance to some cultures. However, a drink or two won't hurt.\n## Sarkitwara Trees\nSarkitwara trees are a type of citron tree native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have yellow leaves and orange, segmented fruit.\n### Sarkitwara\nSarkitwara themselves are the plants' segemented orange fruits. Their segments can be removed whole, and individually peeled, revealing a pithy orange-like flesh, with large black seeds within.\n\nWhen unripe, the fruit releases flashes of light when disturbed, through the use of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md). This is to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat the fruit before it is ready to germinate.\n\nWild Sarkitwara are foraged by some minikin cultures, and some varieties were domesticated, such as the Morellic Sarkitwara, which began to be cultivated in orchards by the Sarvaran minikin.\n### Pelen\nPelen is a plant native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They are similar to carrot plants, only with larger, wider, red roots, and are farmed by many Minikin cultures.\n### Pelenroots\nPelenroots are the large root vegetable of the Pelen plant. They are large, wide, and feature a deep red hue. They are eaten by many minikin cultures and are typically boiled before consumption.\n### Pelen Leaves\nPelen Leaves are the leaves of the Pelen plant. They are large, green, and edible. They are eaten by some minikin cultures, using them similar to lettuce.\n### Pelen Red\nPelen Red is a dye engineered by the Sarvaran minikin, taken from the deep red colour of Pelenroots, which get their colour from high concentrations of betanin and carotene. \n## Lunaflower Plants\nLunaflower plants are native to the 2nd and -3rd realms.

It is foraged by some minikin cultures, eaten on their own, and pressed into Lunaflower oil.\n### Lunaflower Oil\nLunaflower oil is transparent and pink. It is squeezed out of Lunaflowers and used in many situations, including anointing, cooking, and lubrication.\n## Lunuth Wheat\nLunuth wheat is a grass native to the 2nd realm. It is the domesticated version of Lunuth wildgrass, and was one of the first plants to be farmed by the early Sarvaran civilisation.\n### Lunuth Grains\nLunuth wheat produces small grains with hard, purple hulls. These grains are typically ground into light pink lunuth flour, or pressed into crimson lunuth oil.\n### Lunuth Bread\nLunuth bread has been a staple food of many minikin cultures, even non-agricultural groups. It has a slight purple hue beside from being mainly beige and brown. It is typically leavened, sprinkled with Nyuta seeds, and eaten with lunaflower oil.\n### Lunuth-based Textiles\nAs well as being able to be turned into bread, Lunuth is farmed by some minikin cultures for it's long, flax-like fibres, which are turned into thread or woven into Lunuth fabric. In some regions of Qherell, Lunuth was the first plant to be used in textiles, revolutionising the craft for the Sarvaran Civilisation.\n## Aqhoran Rice Plants\n\n### Aqhoran White Rice\n\n## Glowpear Trees\nGlowpear trees are a type of tree native to the 2nd and -1st realms. Their leaves are deep green and their fruit are glowing blue. They are grown in orchards by some Minikin cultures.\n### Glowpears\nGlowpears are the fruit of the glowpear tree. They are similar to pears, with the main difference being their luminous, vibrant blue-cyan colour. Their juice similarly glows, owing to the presence of [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md). They are sometimes foraged by some Minikin cultures.\n### Glowpear Leaves\nGlowpear Leaves are the leaves of the glowpear tree. They are shiny, with a deep green complexion. They are inedible to Minikin, but serve as a vital food source for herbivorous livestock such as bushdeer, wooly hogs, and pack-snails.\n## Dreamberry Bushes\nDreamberry bushes are a plant native to the 2nd and 1st realms similar to raspberry plants. They feature long, creeping branches with small green leaves and sharp thorns.\n### Dreamberries\nDreamberries are small berries similar to cloudberries which range in colour from orange to pink depending on variety. They are foraged and eaten by some minikin cultures, making up a large part of their diets.\n### Dreamberry Jam\nDreamberry jam is a jam made out of Dreamberries. It was first invented by the Sarvaran minikin, whom ate it alone or spread on or inside of Lunuth bread loaves, sandwiches, or baguettes.\n### Dreamberry Wine\nDreamberry wine was also invented by the Sarvaran minikin, and was their preferred alcoholic drink of choice. Dreamberries got their name from the dreamy effect that drunkenness on the wine would provide the Sarvarans.\n### Use\nDreamberry bushes are used by some Minikin cultures to defend bases and stockpiles. They are planted in hedges at the base of trees, walls, and burrows, warding off opportunists who may want to eat stored food or attack those beyond the bushes.\n## Elkfruit Trees\n\n### Elkfruit\n\n### Elkfruit Wine\n\n## Darkwort\n\n### Darkwort Vines\n\n### Darkwort Leaves\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["flora","2nd realm"]},"/species/fungi/macrofungi":{"title":"bean","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-16T15:25:44.747931778Z","tags":["meta"]},"/species/mundozoa":{"title":"Mundozoa","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nMundozoa is the term for the paraphyletic group of all animals native to the essent realms that genetically originate from the fauna of the 0th realm.\n\nAs per their paraphyly, they are not a group with common ancestry in the traditional sense.
