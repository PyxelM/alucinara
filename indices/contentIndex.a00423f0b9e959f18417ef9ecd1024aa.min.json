It causes those affected, known as Phantasms, to experience irreversable physical and mental effects, leading to the growth of Alucinarium on the body and psychosis.\n## Contraction\nPhantasmarrhoea is contracted through exposure to more [Alucinara energy](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) than the body can handle, varying depending on the levels of exposure and one's immunity to the adverse effects of Alucinara.\n## Symptoms\nThe many symptoms of Phantasmarrhoea are marked by:\n- The accumulation of Alucinarium in the body and on the skin\n- Infertility\n- Hair loss, or Alopecia\n- Hallucinations\n- Psychosis, paranoia, and violent, antisocial behaviour \n- Pale, purple skin and eyes\n- Skin irritation, rashes, and pain\n- Blindness\n- Essential Shift into the infra-essent realms.\n## Appearance\nPhantasms' appearance is defined by harsh crystals growing all across their bodies, originating at the hands, feet, and tail. Furthermore, any exposed skin is generally pink, translucent, and pale, with blood vessels visible from beneath the surface, and their eyes are often pale, with a pink tint. They are often accompanied by orbs and sparks of light, through which they see, once blindness has set into the eyes.\n## Behaviour\nPhantasms are deeply violent toward other living beings, using the razor-sharp Alucinarium crystals that grow upon their body to scratch and attack others. In addition, their violent behaviour leads them to live solitary, lonely lives in the infra-essent realms.\n## Noteable Phantasms\n- Ketton, father of Riverbed, and founder of the Afortuitous Order","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["conditions","alucinara"]},"/conditions/sharadism":{"title":"Sharadism","content":"## Overview\nSharadism is a physiological condition that affects organic beings. It causes those affected, known as Sharadith[^1], to undergo many irreversable physical, mental, and spiritual changes, resulting in a grotesque appearance and insatiable need to consume the blood and flesh of others.\n## Spiritual Effects\nThe effects of contraction of Sharadism on the soul are markedly drastic. Those affected lose possession of their souls, which return to the pond, and rather the Sharadic Angel sends down its own spirit into the bodies of the Sharadith.\n\nAs the Sharadith's souls are extensions of the Sharadic Angel, and thus holy in the eyes of the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md), they have the capability of committing evil acts (such as murder, cannibalism, and exsanguination) without alerting the Child to destroy them.\n## Contraction\nSharadism is contracted when an organic being is exposed to the bodily fluids of a carrier. Only few carriers are largely symptomless, integrating into society without a problem, and without their condition being discovered.\n\nA common method of contraction is the consumption of tainted animal meat or plant flesh, such as from a hunted animal with Sharadism, or a foraged plant which has gained the condition from contact with another Sharadh.\n\nAnother method is through the deliberate turning of another being. This is customary in some Minikin cultures as criminal punishment, but can also be carried out when a Sharadh pack dwindles in number and the remaining members seek out new recruits. This is achieved through bites or scratches, which penetrate the skin, but do not kill the victim.\n## Turning\nWhen one contracts Sharadism, they don't fully transform into a Sharadh until the night after, usually in their sleep. In this sleep, they appear dead, but don't decompose beyond a pale and dry appearance. Once the transformation is complete, they appear as a Sharadh, and can infect others.\n## Appearance\nSharadith differ in appearance from their healthy counterparts, in that they exhibit:\n- Greater accumulaton of haemoglobin and red iron pigments in the body, leading to a ruddy appearance and red eyes.\n- Complete hair loss or alopecia universalis.\n- A larger body, with longer, sinewy limbs, and thicker nails, due to greater secretion of growth hormones.\n- Stronger bones and teeth, due to remineralisation and greater calcium consumption.\n- Sharper teeth and fingernails, due to a pathological compulsion to file or sharpen them.\n## Behaviour and Pathology\nThe behaviour of Sharadith also differs from their healthy counterparts, as they exhibit:\n- A lack of interest in socialising with others or associating with civilisation, prefering to stay in small, matriarchal groups of other Sharadith.\n- Infertility, leading to new Sharadith being turned only through contraction\n- Unpredictable and socially unacceptable behaviour, hallucinations, confusion, ceaseless anger, and insatiable hunger.\n- Avoidance of cooked or plant-based foodstuffs, preferring wholly to consume raw meat, bones, and blood.\n- Extreme heliophobia and pyrophobia, leading to nocturnal sleeping patterns.\n\n[^1]:**Sarvaran**: Singular *Carádh*, Paucal *Cáradaqh*, Plural *Cáradith* \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic \\*Syazad, meaning 'exsanguinator.'","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["conditions"]},"/conditions/sorcerism":{"title":"Sorcerism","content":"## Overview\nSorcerism is a condition that grants those affected with the ability to manipulate the laws of nature through the use of Alucinara. Sorcerism is more common than uncommon, with more than one subtype.\n## Types\n### Asorcerism\nAsocerism is the condition of lacking the ability to use Alucinara energy. It is commonly caused by spiritual curses, or a congenital or aquired defect in the fortuitary gland, meaning that Alucinarium is unable to be produced by the body, or the spirit is unable to control the energy around it.\n\nAsorcerism is a condition brought about by the body, as living beings' ability to use Alucinara is limited by the effectiveness of their fortuitary gland. Thus, this effectiveness can be checked by injury, age, or by the intervention of angels or powerful sorcerers.\n### Low Sorcerism\nLow sorcerism is the most common subtype of sorcerism, and is the natural state of many species. This type leads those affected to have some level of control over Alucinara energy, and is commonly used for telekinesis, pyrokinesis, energy magic, and to commune with deities.\n### High Sorcerism\nHigh sorcerism, the most uncommon subtype, leads those affected to have an intense degree of control over Alucinara energy. This control can be intentional, instinctual, or inintentional, and is commonly used in order to prophesy, levitate, and cast spells more intensely, or for long periods of time, among other grand effects.\n## Sorcerers\nSorcerers are those who use alucinara energy, and are commonly shamans, healers, priests, warriors, and prophets. Their place in society is commonly contextualised by their condition, and they would largely take jobs and vocations according to their magical abilities.\n### Dark Sorcerers\nSome sorcerers would use their powers for evil, out of faith for unrighteous angels, or for their own unrighteous reasons. These dark (and less often, righteous) sorcerers would commonly have some form of deformity from prolonged exposure to Alucinara, including [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md) or mutations, leading them to have a crusty, bald, animalistic appearance.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["conditions","alucinara"]},"/cosmology/alucinara":{"title":"Alucinara","content":"## Overview\nAlucinara is a form of energy that pertains to the transfer of matter, [thought](cosmology/darkness.md), and other forms of energy between two or more realms. It is vital to the practice of magic, travel between realms, and the existence of consciousness. It is inertly stored within the elemental substance Alucinarium.\n\nWhen matter, thought, or energy is stored within the [dreamscape](cosmology/dreamscape.md), it does not exist in any physical form, as the dreamscape is an incorporeal realm. Rather, it is suspended until Alucinara energy can transfer it back into physical form.\n\nWhen thought is transferred from the dreamscape, it is manifested in the form of [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md), which forms the content of the soul within living beings. When darkness is exhausted, it causes thought to act upon the physical realms, triggering effects such as levitation, telepathy, or thermokinesis. It is through this method that many people are made prophets or oracles, especially through contact with incorporeal entities of the dreamscape, often worshipped as deities.\n## Magic\nMagic is the practice of utilising Alucinara energy in order to manipulate the physical world to achieve a desired effect. In magic, Alucinara is cast through spells or deliberately exposed to the user. Users of magic are known as spellcasters or sorcerers.\n## Effects and Uses\nAlucinara can cause effects such as:\n- Telekinesis; Psychokinesis, Levitation\n- Thermokinesis; Pyrokinesis, Cryokinesis\n- Telepathy; Clairvoyance, Precognition","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["alucinara","cosmology","phenomena"]},"/cosmology/darkness":{"title":"Darkness","content":"## Overview\nDarkness is the physical manifestation of thought, allowing it to exist within the corporeal realms and outside of the [dreamscape](cosmology/dreamscape.md).

It hovers through space to locomote, and destroys the purpetrators of evil by transfiguring them into a material known as 'Baby Sludge.\n### Baby Sludge\nBaby Sludge is a highly fertile, soil-like substance created upon the destruction of evil by the Petrified Child. It was designed by the Judges to trigger the proliferation of the natural world, resulting in beautiful regions of ecosystemic prosperity known as Baby Meadows.\n\nHowever, baby sludge itself is highly dangerous before it is incorporated into nature. It highly fortifies all aspects of nature to achieve its goal (including decay, rot, pathogens, and bacteria), resulting in swift death through infection or necrosis to those who come in contact with it.\n## Appearance\nWithin the corporeal realms, the Petrified Child is bound within rock, as all beings with a [soul](cosmology-1/darkness.md) require a body to exist within the physical realms.

The language of Sarvara was Classical Sarvaran, a Southern Morellic language. The civilisation traces it's origins to the [Mora](factions/mora.md), a neolithic tribe native to the southern Tseirephic steppes.\n## History\nThe earliest records of habitation in the surrounding region of the city of Sarvara come from the [Diira](factions/diira*.md), who established an early farming community and religious centre known as Sabelin. The settlement was abandoned during the conflicts of the [Morellic Migration](events/morellic-migration*.md), and ultimately resettled by the Sarvarans.\n\nSarvara became the most prominent and innovative power of Bronze Age [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md), a centre of science, art, and religion for centuries until it was burnt by the [Aqhorans](factions/aqhor). The civilisation of Sarvara was succeeded by the [Corothic](factions/coroth.md) [Empire of the Petrified Child](factions/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md).\n## Societal Structure\nThe Sarvarans lived in semi-arboreal cities and villages led by noble matriarchs, who were given power and influence over certain regions by their suzerains. The society was led by the High Matriarch, who held the monarchal, hereditary role of power over the whole of Sarvaran civilisation.\n### Religion\nThe religion of Sarvara was largely monotheistic, centred around the deity of the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md). However, the [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) were also venerated, and often called upon in times of need. The nobles of Sarvara often held priestly roles, with power centralised in the temples.\n### Gender Roles\nWomen held an almost sacred role in Sarvaran society, with adult women required to shave their heads and perform ritual ablutions twice a day; women performed the roles of spiritual leaders, weavers, and artists. Men were often farmers and labourers, letting their long hair down or tied into buns. Both male and female Sarvaran nobles could dedicate themselves to science and innovation for the sake of their society.\n### Caste System\nThe Caste system of Sarvara was characterised by vast inequality. Women were seen above men, and the society was led by a ruling caste of matriarchs and priestly nobles, with the soldiers, commoners, and outcasts below. It was taboo to mix these castes by marriage or proximity.\n## Clothing\nSarvarans often wore woven clothing made of [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) linen and [Yurikh](fauna/yurikhs.md) leather. Women and men wore thigh-length tunics with leather belts and bell-shaped sleeves, with puffy trousers resembling shorts or breeches, and a thick coat worn over the tunic made of fur or cotton. Leather shoes were also common.\n## Language\n[Classical Sarvaran](languages/classical-sarvaran.md) is the polysynthetic, head marking, SOV language of the Sarvaran [minikin](fauna/minikin.md). It has noun incorporation and lacks cases and the definite article, but has an extensive lexicon of prepositions, persons, aspects, and moods.\n## Calendar\nThe Sarvaran calendar is a lunisolar calendar, following the cycle of the moon 'Ena' around the sun 'Cadra'. It is made up of 8 months, which are made up of 4 weeks of 8 days, with three days of rest and worship at the end of every week. ThSarvarae years are counted from the birth of the Sarvaran prophet [Ancira](characters/ancira.md), a [Moraic](factions/mora.md) matriarch who performed miracles for the benefit of her people with the aid of the [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md).","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["groups","civilisation","morellic","sarvara"]},"/fauna/bushdeer":{"title":"Bushdeer","content":"## Overview\nBushdeer are a genus of deer native to the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and -1st realms.

They inhabit the plains and continental forests of [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md).\n## Appearance\nBushdeer can vary in height according to species, from 30cm to 1m at the shoulder. They feature dark, brown fur, with green mossy patches, and a white fur pattern that mimics exposed bone, causing the bushdeer to appear rotten and inedible to predators. Their antlers are covered by kleptoplastic leaves, allowing the bushdeer not only to camouflage in the greenery, but also photosynthesise during periods of cessation.\n## Species\nSome species of Bushdeer are large and muscular, living on the ground, in plains, forests, and sometimes rocky habitats. In contrast, some species are smaller, such as the pygmy bushdeer, which is specialised for an arboreal lifestyle, blending in with the canopy.\n## Behaviour\nBushdeer behaviour is defined by periods of hibernation and apparent death. Not only do they  hibernate in the winter as their metabolism slows down and they are sustained by photosynthesis, but they also play dead when threatened. They are kept safe by their markings that deter would-be predators.\n\nFurthermore, male bushdeer are greatly territorial, using their sharp hooves and antlers to attack mating competition and other animals that trespass into the deer's territory. Females are likewise violent, protecting their young from predators and using [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) to force them from harm's way.\n## Hunting\nBushdeer are hunted by some [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) groups where their territories overlap; for example, pygmy bushdeer are an ideal prey animal due to the ease required to hunt them compared to bulkier species. Their 'leaves' are a delicacy in many Minikin cultures, being used in meals such as salads and stews alongside other meats and true leaves.\n## Diet\nBushdeer have a herbivorous diet, consuming mainly leaves, weeds, flowers, and fruit. It is from their diet that they gain the chloroplasts needed to photosynthesise.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.061746463Z","tags":["fauna","cervids","infra-essent-realms","ultra-essent-realms"]},"/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"## Overview\nDragons are a genus of amphibians native to the -1st, -3rd, and all ultra-essent realms, including the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md).

They are effective mimickers of nature, camouflaging themselves against rock, sand, and dirt.\n### Leaf Dragons\nLeaf dragons are a subspecies of flight-capable earth dragon which inhabit the canopy. They use kleptoplasty to photosynthesise, using many small leaf-like organs on their back to catch sunlight.\n### Magic Dragons\nMagic Dragons are flight-capable and inhabit the forests and plains of the -3rd realm. They have a greater ability to withstand the energy of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md), owing to their habitat. They use alucinara in order to manipulate objects, speak, and confuse predators.\n## Life Cycle\nDragons lay their spawn in damp, wet, areas, such as ponds.

Generally, they are 25-30cm tall, bipedal and anthropoid, with a snouted face, pointed ears, a long, bushy tail, and 4-fingered hands and digitigrade feet, with sharp claws and specialised teeth for tearing flesh and grinding plant matter.\n\nFur distributions and skin colour varies with the climate; for example, a Minikin from a hotter climate may have less fur and darker skin, whereas a Minikin from a colder climate may have more fur and lighter skin. Likewise, eye colour and hair colour can vary accordingly.\n### Dimorphism\nMinikin males tend to be taller than women, about 30 cm in height, and more bulky. Women, in contrast, lack as much hair as males (such as nose hair) and reach a stature of about 25 cm.\n### Children\nMinikin children are small, about 5cm in length, and more squirrel-like than their elders. They are hairless at birth, but quickly grow out a thick coat of fur across the body, which permanently sheds before sexual maturity.\n## Diet\nMinikin are omnivores, mainly eating a diet of small mammals, fruit (and their juice), amphibians, vegetables, fish, leaves, and tree bark; and after the invention of agriculture, minikin began to eat and drink bread, beer, and wine.\n\nEating is a social experience for Minikin, who mainly do so with family, friends, and lovers. They don't do so with those they don't trust, as it is an experience where one can let down their guard, without fear of being attacked or poisoned.\n## Predators\nMinikin are an ideal prey animal for their small size, but are formidable for their smart intellect and use of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md). They are hunted by various animals, which they often worship and / or venerate, such as [widrens](fauna/widrens.md), [weasels](fauna/weasels.md), and [direwolves](private/trash/fauna/direwolves.md).\n## Sociology\nMinikin are a very social species, living in familial groups or clans. Due to the mother's importance within Minikin families, many cultures are matriarchal.\n\nAt the advent of the Minikin Bronze Age, many clans began to unite under a common cultural identity into city states and nations, which would go on to expand, colonise, and build empires.\n### Religion\nMinikin religion, as with the religions of other sapient species, is based upon the worship of the celestial beings; including the Judges, the Petrified Child, and / or the Angels.\n\nThese beings are worshipped on holy days, in holy locations, or in temples, and communed with by those in priestly or high positions within the social heirarchy.\n### Clothing\nMinikin fashion clothing out of leaves, animal skin / leather, plant fibre, and wool; creating tunics, skirts, and coats, among other items of clothing. Weaving was an industry pioneered early in Minikin development.\n### Agriculture\nAngriculture was innovated in Minikin society at many independent points, but generally spells the end of the Neolithic era (or New Stone Age) and the dawn of the Bronze Age.\n\nMinikin use tools such as sticks or scythes to harvest plants, which include Lunuth wheat, Sweetrice, fruit, berries, vegetables, and Pelen.\n### Hunting and Warfare\nFurthermore, Minikin also fashion spears, blades, and clubs in order to defeat prey animals or enemies. Due to the use of [Alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) energy, Minikin do not have use for bows, as they can drive arrows into prey and others by casting a kinetic spell.\n\nSome Minikin domesticate animals such as Weasels in order to ride into battle with other nations, clans, or predators, using their weapons and magic from atop their steed or from the ground in order to succeed against their foe.\n### Structures\nMinikin structures are used for many purposes, such as for homes, places of storage, bath-houses, or temples. They generally constructed these structures with clay, Lunuth straw, wood, bitumen, and stones.\n### Ground-Level\nOn the ground, structures were built on solid ground and otherwise upon flat, stone foundations. These were more often farms, temples, and bathhouses, where waste could be easily taken and used as compost.\n### Farms\nFarms could be built on ground-level or in the canopy, depending on their type. Farms which grew crops such as Lunuth wheat or berries were set up on ground level, where seeds could be sewn. Within the canopy, farms were set up to farm the fruit of the trees, such as Dhajar nuts or Sarkitwara, or the goods of various small animals which inhabited the trees, such as silk from silkworms or moths.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.062746372Z","tags":["fauna","minikin","ultra-essent-realms","sapient-species"]},"/fauna/pringis":{"title":"Pringis","content":"## Overview\nPringis, also known as Pygmy Antelopes, are a species of antelope native to the steppes and mediterranean regions of the 1st and [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) realms.

They feature 2 pneumostomes at the base of their neck, a mollusk foot, and 4 tentacle-like arms. They have smooth, wet, grey-brown skin with black spots, and are entirely hairless.\n## Children\nSlugfolk children are miniscule, only about 1cm in length when they hatch from their eggs. They are fed a solution of specialised mucus from their parents, similar to milk in mammals, containing nutrients, protien, and glucose for the child to grow and thrive. Many Slugfolk children perish young, so litters can reach up to 50 eggs in one spawning.\n## Behaviour\nSlugfolk are crepuscular, awake in the twilight of dusk and dawn, and only come out in humid or wet weather. They spend their time in semi-subterranean complexes, collecting mud in their mouths which they use to fortify walls and create structures above-ground.\n\nThey generally build these complexes in wetland climates or nearby water sources such as oases and springs. This allows them a humid climate where they are unlikely to dessicate and perish, and where they can easily hydrate themselves.\n### Language\nThey utilise [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) to generate tones and rhythms by telekinetically vibrating an organ within their bodies which they use to communicate, attenuating these tones with their pneumostomes. This allows them to communicate with species with different speech anatomy, such as [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), by replicating the sound of their speech.\n## Diet\nSlugfolk are herbivorous, consuming living and rotting plant matter such as leaves, vegetables, wood, fruit, and seeds. Some civilisations grind down and / or dehydrate food for later use, rehydrating them with nearby water sources.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.062746372Z","tags":["fauna","slugfolk","ultra-essent-realms","sapient-species"]},"/fauna/treemice":{"title":"Treemice","content":"## Overview\nTreemice are a species of small arboreal primates native to the 1st and [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) realms.

They are solitary nocturnal hunters, hunting and surviving alone once they are mature. They make their nests in treetops, and their young are known to fight one another to filter out the weak. Once they leave their nests, they go out to find a mate, and the cycle repeats until they are old and unable to hunt.\n\nThey use [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) to induce hallucinations and flashes of light in prey, and to keep them in place and stop them from escaping.

They had light brown skin and lacked much hair, with an eye colour of hazel. They lived in matriarchal communities and spoke a language reconstructed as [Proto-Nethic](languages/proto-nethic.md).\n## Societal Structure\nThe Diira lived in familial, migratory comunities led by a matriarchal elder woman who would command, judge, represent, and aid the group in survival and diplomacy. Eunuch shamans would also lead each group in worship, following a form of polytheistic animism.\n### Gender Roles\nDiiran society saw people categorised into 3 genders; men, women, and a third non-binary gender termed as Eunuchs[^1]. Women often assumed roles as flock keepers, guardians of children, and leaders; while men often wove clothing, sowed wild seeds, and performed hard labour. Eunuchs were seen as being in-between the two other genders, bridging the gap between them, and took on roles as philosophers, strategists, innovators, and spiritual leaders.\n## Lifestyle\nThe Diira were semi-nomadic pastoralist hunter-gatherers, travelling and settling in and across the various areas of southern Tseireph. They lived in huts made of sticks and animal hide, where the families would sleep and rest, and would settle in an area if it proved to have an advantageous amount of food, such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, and small prey animals.\n### Proto-Farming\nSome Diiran groups would settle in a certain area, find a good amount of plants, and leave not once they and their flocks had exhausted the area; rather they would leave some left, so the ecosystem could regrow. This developed into a form of proto-farming that eventually involved the spreading of seeds, annual harvests, and agriculture. This practice would go on to influence many Bronze-Age agricultural civilisations such as [Neth](groups/neth.md) and [Sarvara](groups/sarvara.md).\n\n[^1]: The English term 'Eunuch' is not analoguous to the Diiran nonbinary gender, but the word is used for convenience's sake.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.063746281Z","tags":["groups","tribes","nethic"]},"/locations/2nd-realm":{"title":"The Second Realm","content":"## Overview\nThe 2nd realm is an ultra-essent realm, and has a moderate [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) intensity.

They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain Alucinara and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks.

It is often taken advantage of by living beings in order to manipulate the physical world in supernatural and otherwise unnachievable ways.\n## Appearance\nAlucinara energy itself is invisible, as it is not made up of matter, but rather metaphysical particles known as Alucinons. These alucinons can achieve physical form, however, when in high enough concentrations, manifesting as the crystalline element of Alucinarium (`Ac`).\n\nAlucinarium is an iridescent purple crystal with a bright orange lustre. It grows in long, razor-sharp, pyramidal shapes, which can be thin or wide. It is a very bristly crystal, breaking off easily into small chunks and dust. Alucinarium dust generally dissapears, but can have a longer lifespan in areas of high alucinon saturation.\n## Uses\nAlucinara is capable of doing many things. Its use can be unconscious, as in basal organisms and plants, or consciously used as in magic by sapient species. These uses range from allowing users to travel between [realms](cosmology-1/the-realms.md), levitate objects and themselves, to cook food, to burn or freeze objects, and to commune with [spiritual beings](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) as in prophecy and prayer; although this is not an exhausive list.\n## Sorcerers\nSorcerers are those who specialise in Alucinara use, and are capable of more difficult, high-complexity spells compared to laypeople and nonsapient animals, which may use Alucinara at a lower level of complexity, or simply as a biological process out of evolutionary instinct.\n## Consciousness\nAs Alucinara energy provides a bridge between the dreamscape and the corporeal realms, it has many consciousness-like effects. For example, when information is kept within the dreamscape, it can be stored and recalled on command.\n\nIt is for this reason that matter and energy can be seen to store and recall memory, resulting in the foundations for the existence of the [soul](cosmology-1/darkness.md).

The central 0th realm contains the least amount of alucinara energy and the 3rd and -3rd contain the most.\n\nThe terms [Ultra-essent](tags/ultra-essent-realms) and [Infra-essent](tags/infra-essent-realms) refer to the positioning of the realms. Within Sarvaran tradition, the Ultra-essent realms are placed higher, and the infra-essent realms lower, with height corresponding to the percieved impurity and purity of each realm.\n### The 0th Realm\nThe 0th realm contains the least amount of alucinara energy, with only enough to support time and consciousness. This realm contains planets such as Earth, which was one of the only planets capable of supporting life within the realm. Within [Sarvaran](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md) tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of dark green.\n### The 1st Realm\nThe 1st realm contains planets such as [Aandra](locations/aandra.md), which was the home of the sapient species of [Slugfolk](fauna/Slugfolk.md). Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of orange-yellow.\n### The 2nd Realm\nThe 2nd realm contains planets such as [Kherelh](lore/2nd-realm/Kherelh.md), which was the home of the sapient species of [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md), which founded the civilisations of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md) and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md). Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of light green.\n### The 3rd Realm\nThe 3rd realm contains the most alucinara energy, alongside the -3rd. Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour red.\n## The Infra-Essent Realms\n### The -1st Realm\nWithin Sarvaran tradition, the -1st realm is associated with the colour of darkness.\n### The -2st Realm\nWithin Sarvaran tradition, the -2nd realm is associated with the colour blue.\n### The -3rd Realm\nThe -3rd realm contains the most alucinara energy, alongside the 3rd. It is home to many deadly species of plants and animals, and is the place many victims of [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md) are shifted to, making it a highly dangerous place. Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour purple.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.087744096Z","tags":["lore","cosmology"]},"/private/showcase-video-scripts/i.-the-realms":{"title":"Script to Showcase Ep. 1","content":"## Part 0: Intro\nThousands of years ago, before wheat was first planted and bread first baked, there was two judges over the cosmos. The first Judge was named Ena, and the second Udru. They created the world, they created the angels to govern it, and they created magic.\n\nUltimately, Udru rebelled against Ena, creating life. Living beings were never meant to exist in that creation, and they hungered to consume the world they had been born into, or else they would die. Over the course of millenia, they destroyed the cosmos, and eventually made an attempt on the lives of the Judges.\n\nIn their dying moments, the Judges bound the living beings within bodies of flesh, and were ultimately destroyed. The energy of their perishing spirits was now released in an explosion that shattered the cosmos into 7 pieces.\n## Part i: What Are the Realms?\nThere are 8 realms, the 7 corporeal realms that resulted from the shattering, and the 1 incorporeal realm known as the 'Dreamscape.' The realms are independent planes of existence, each containing their own cosmoi and differing levels of magic.\n\nThe realms are listed from -3rd to positive 3rd. The 0th realm, containing Earth, contains the least amount of magic compared to the -3rd and 3rd, which contain the most. The infra-essent realms, below the 0th, are traditionally darker, compared to the ultra-essent, which are traditionally lighter.\n### Part iia: The Dreamscape and Alucinara\nThe dreamscape is the only incorporeal realm. It lacks a physical plane, but rather contains information. The angels, created by the Judges, and the Petrified Child reside within the dreamscape, although the Petrified Child is the only celestial being with a physical form.\n\nThe dreamscape can be accessed through magic, also known as Alucinara energy, which allows the dreamscape to affect the physical realms. This results in anomalous and supernatural phenomena, the effects of which can be controlled, and **are** controlled by plants, animals, sorcerers, and prophets.\n\nConsciousness, thought, and memory all proceed from the Dreamscape, and so Alucinara energy is an essential part of the soul, alongside the energy of Darkness, which converts the information of the dreamscape into neural impulses.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.087744096Z","tags":["writing","script"]},"/private/writing/drafts/draft-1":{"title":"If Only (Draft 1, 22 Nov 2021)","content":"## Chapter 1\n\nWoodlice, dirt, and leaves. These were the first things little Blueberry saw when he woke up. This environment he had found himself in seemed like a poor imitation of what he was used to, which was a constant supply of cucumber and the fibreglass tree stump he called home - but this wasn't his home, this was something else.\n\nAs Blueberry got up, the first thing he noticed other than the lice, dirt, and leaves was a small raspberry which almost felt like a relief to see as it was Blueberry's favourite food, with a note next to it written in some other language he didn't know.\n\nSlowly enjoying his raspberry, Blueberry started to realise his predicament. This was not a dream as he had first thought, but is a serious situation - one which he didn't have a full grasp of. Having finished his final bite of the berry, Blueberry walked onward in an attempt to figure out where he was, or why he had even been abandoned from his old life, sleeping inside the fibreglass tree stump, which itself was inside a glass terrarium of sorts.\n\nTrawling along a path, which was cloaked by an interconnected net of brambles and leaves, Blueberry began to get emotional, sitting atop a pebble, quietly sobbing to himself. He missed his tree-stump, he missed his cucumber. Knowing that he doesn't know his way home, the little guy looked around, sobbing harder than before, and that was when he saw a sparkle come from the heavens.\n\nNot trusting his eyes, Blueberry blinked rubbed his tears away, and noticed it again - it was unmistakably a sprinkle of iridescent dust coming from above. Having stopped crying, Blueberry asked who was there, his voice hoarse.\n\n\"Haha,\" a small but mellifluous voice called out, \"It's, uh, me.\"  \nBlueberry was quite confused, not having heard a voice of such quality before. \"And who might you be?\" he responded, his eyebrow raised.  \n\"I am the stool under which the toad sits, the shoe in which which the lady lives.\" The voice cryptically rang out.  \n\"So... your name is Toadstool?\" Blueberry asked inquisitively.  \n\"I am the sun and the moon, the-\" The voice was cut off by Blueberry, who grumpily called out \"Cut the nonsense, Lad.\"  \n\"Well if you're gonna act like that... Alright. My name might as well be Toadstool.\" It said, slowly fluttering down to reveal its appearance.\n\nToadstool seemed to be a fairy, adorned with pastel blue hair and green clothes with flowers tucked in each pocket. \"I'm a fairy.\" Toadstool proclaimed, his hair fluttering against his pointy ears. Dumbstruck by the fairy's appearance, Blueberry stammered as he replied. \"I... am Blueberry.\" He said, holding his hand out introductorily.\n\nShaking Blueberry's hand gleefully, Toadstool smiled and replied. \"Booberry... huh. Strange name.\" Having misheard Blueberry. \"No-\" Blueberry tried to reply, cut off by Toadstool's hasty attempts to drag him deeper into where they were.\n\n\"Come on Booberry, if you're here in the wild ya gotta know you way around!\" Toadstool gleefully said, grabbing Blueberry's hand and dragging him off to someplace new. Blueberry, startled by being dragged from his rocky perch, noticed that Toadstool's hand was covered in the same iridescent dust that he has seen earlier when Toadstool was above him.\n\nBlueberry didn't expect Toadstool's hand to feel as comfortable as it did, but that may have been because the both of them were flying. As they drifted through the air, Blueberry started to find it hard to focus on the sadness of being away from his home and, surprisingly, he was okay with that. The only thing on his mind was that he was flying.\n\nBlueberry had never flown before, on account of the fact that he was particularly slimy and sluggish, so this experience was very new to him and he didn't know what to make of it other than the feelings he already knew, such as touch, smell, and sight. Although he had a hard time understanding what was in front of him, he still tried to keep a smile on his face as he looked at Toadstool.\n\n\"Cool Scenery, huh?\" Toadstool said, looking onward.  \n\"Scenery? All I've known is my home.\" Blueberry responded, reflecting on his old tree stump.  \n\"Um... Do you not know what scenery is...?\" Toadstool uttered incredulously.  \nBlueberry tried to answer, his forefinger outstretched, but found that he couldn't muster a response. After a moment of silence only broken by the wind rushing past them, Blueberry managed to reply; \"I can't truthfully describe what I'm seeing right now.\"\n\n\"Really? You don't know what a pond is? Or a tree?\" Toadstool said after a pause saturated with thoughts.  \n\"I know what water is, or what leaf is. Just not a pond, nor a tree; a tree stump, however...\" Blueberry replied, thinking about the features of his life.  \n\"Well, a pond is a big collection of water. Y'know, the clear stuff, and leaves grow on trees which're big planty structures.\" Toadstool replied. Blueberry didn't, as he had nothing much to say, but this was quickly alleviated by Toadstool shouting out loud - \"Hey, we're almost above Morelland!\"  \nAlmost startled by Toadstool's outburst, Blueberry quickly responded with \"Uh... Where?\"  \n\"Uh, there!\" Toadstool replied, pointing to a colony of mushrooms next to a pond.  \nBlueberry knew what mushrooms were, as they were a rare but delightful foodstuff he'd be given at times, but he didn't think they would be deserving of the title, \"-Land.\"  \n\"Those little things? You're making me hungry, man.\" He said, as he and Toadstool veered to the left and downward, nearing the area.\n\nAs Blueberry and Toadstool landed, Blueberry recoiled at the fairy's fluttering wings as they came to a stop. With both their feet on the ground, Blueberry let go of Toadstool's hand, revealing that he had been given his own fair share of iridescent dust from Toadstool's hand, which he quickly brushed off against a clump of green moss.\n\n\"This is Morland...?\" Blueberry asked, mispronouncing the name since he was unimpressed with the lack of infrastructure.  \n\"No, have you ever been out in the wild befo... oh yeah, you haven't!\" Toadstool hastily replied, only halfway through realising that yes - his newfound acquaintance hadn't been out in the wild, (of course, except for his enclosure.)  \n\"It seems you've more experience than I'd have thought, though; you've already opened an Ālūcinārī Gateway.\" He added, noting the flowing spiral emitting a full array of colours behind Blueberry. Blueberry jumped as he noticed it, surprised by the glowing whirl of hues which was coming from the moss.\n\n\"I wouldn't put it past you to jump, but it was you who did conjure it.\" Toadstool mentioned, patting Blueberry on the back.  \n\"I didn't make it - I... I just brushed the dust on my hand against some moss.\" Blueberry responded, visibly disturbed by the sight.  \n\"Not the first time I've seen someone get so perturbed by an Ālū' Gateway, I'm gonna need to to listen to me close if you wanna see the entirety of Morelland.\" Toadstool said, looking Blueberry straight in the eyes as he took a small pouch out of one of his many pockets.\n\n\"Gateways can be an extremely difficult thing to get through, but eventually, everyone gets through.\" He added, wrapping a small blue velvet cloth he took from the pouch around his arm. \"Grab onto my arm, and just follow my lead.\"\n\nThe two of them stepped in, Blueberry meekly hiding behind Toadstool. As the spiral engulfed them, Blueberry couldn't help but feel the immense forces upon him as he felt his essence float around like a butterfly - leaving his body and re-entering like a sheepish firefly. Round and round and round the two of them went within the Ālūcinārī Gateway, and as the transportation reached it's zenith, Blueberry found it hard to stay conscious, and eventually, scared he may let go of Toadstool, fainted.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.087744096Z","tags":["writing","draft","if only"]},"/private/writing/drafts/draft-2":{"title":"If Only (Draft 2, 17 Oct 2023)","content":"## Chapter 1\n\nPeople are made for one another, to live and love in the company of those they care about. But in the midst of the undergrowth, someone was left. He was utterly alone. He wasn’t awake, but he was alive, his breath shallowly flaring into cold mist.\n\nHis eyes fluttered up as the sun came out from below the horizon, bathing the forest in golden sunlight that washed his body with light enough to wake all things this side of the world. His body weakly buckled as he got up, beginning to thirstily trudge onward. He needed help.\n\nSome people need love, some need riches, but what he needed most was water. A fire, a home, a lover, all of this was irrelevant in the wake of the instinctual drive to survive that came over him like a wild animal.\n\nHis need was satisfied in part when he found a cluster of berries hidden amongst leaf-litter. He felt vitality return as he ate.\n\n‘Enjoying those?’ A voice called out. The man jumped, looking around, but there was nobody there.\n\n‘You think you can eat anything you find out here? Food is scarce. And judging by how you look, it seems you aren’t used to how this place works.’ The voice added.\n\n‘What is this place?’ The man timidly responded.\n\n‘You think I know? I just know things live here. Big, ugly people. And beasts. If we’re not safe, we could get eaten.’\n\n‘What are you doing here then?\n\n‘What are You doing here?’ It said, deflecting the inquiry.\n\nThe man paused. ‘Where are you anyway?’\n\n‘Up.’ The voice quickly increased in volume as the word progressed. In a thud and a puff of leaves, the voice fell to the ground, coalescing into a figure as it now stood before the man.\n\n‘What are you?’ The man exclaimed.\n\n‘Toad Stool, son of Toad Petal, from Amanitaville.’ The figure declared. ‘You can call me Toadstool.’\n\n‘No, What are you?’\n\n‘Thought this might be a problem. I am a Minikin.’\n\nThe man stared at Toadstool as if he were inspecting a newborn. He had a bushy tail, but was hairless apart from it and a head of dark-green hair. His face was elongated into a whiskered snout and a large, wide nose, and his eyes differed to the man’s. The man’s eyes sat upon stalks, but Toadstool’s sat inside the sides of his face. His skin was also smooth.\n\n‘Now, I know What you are, a Slugfolk, but I don’t know who you are.’ Toadstool declared.\n\n‘I’m Aanurku jau Nghwaluu, son of Siiranlat jat Nghwaalut.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘That’s my name.’\n\n‘I’ll just call you Blueberry.’ Toadstool conceded, pointing at what Blueberry had just eaten. ‘That’s what you get for eating my lunch. And where are you from?’\n\n‘From…’\n\nThe forest silently awaited the conclusion to his response. Despite the patience of the trees, the birds chirped stubbornly alongside the distant, echoing drone of habitation.\n\n‘Can you just get me out of here?’ Blueberry said; a response never came. ‘I need to find a place to live.’\n\n‘It doesn’t matter. I know you’re from the place other Slugfolk are from, although I’ve never been. But yes, I’m better than other people out here–I’ll let you in. Follow me.’\n\nBlueberry sighed cathartically when he heard this, beginning to follow Toadstool as he walked through the greenery. Blueberry looked around, taking in the environment. It was all new to him. He couldn't keep his eyes from the trinkets that dangled from Toadstool's bag.\n\n‘So, what’s that?’ Blueberry asked, making conversation. ‘That golden ring on your back.’\n\n‘An ornament.’\n\n‘What do you have it for?\n\n‘Décor.’\n\n‘And that chain, those coins rattling around inside of your rucksack?’\n\n‘...’\n\n‘Why are you dodging the question?’\n\nToadstool turned around to face Blueberry. ‘None of your business. Just follow me, ask no questions, not until we’re under some shelter.’\n\nBlueberry paused for a second as Toadstool took the initiative to turn forward once more. He stared at his back inquisitively.\n\nThe two walked through a thicket, coming upon a tunnel into the ground. It had been dug years ago, judging by the way the dirt had been packed over time, and was only just small enough for the two to pass through–a rabbit couldn’t even get inside without much struggle. The sunlight began to dim as they advanced further and deeper into the seemingly endless tunnel, which eventually widened.\n\nThe light began to grow once more. Happening upon a room, Blueberry was relieved to be in a place he could rest. There were straw beds elevated on the ground with which to sleep and a few wooden boards wedged into the earthen walls, all of which were adorned with candles which lit up the room in orange.\n\nToadstool pulled a rock over the entrance, setting his rucksack atop one of the boards, and sat on the edge of one of the beds.\n\n‘So.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘What’s your story?’\n\n‘Well. You know I’m a “Slugfolk.” What else is there to say?’\n\n‘Come on. There’s more to you than your species, right?’\n\n‘I, uh…’ Blueberry mumbled, stuttering. ‘Tell me why I should trust you first.’\n\n‘Because I’m in control. Look at you–you’re wearing rags, your weak spot isn’t even covered… I saw you laying there in the brush; one well placed spear through your pneumostome and that would be it.’\n\n‘Is that a threat?’\n\n‘No, no… I’m just saying. I’m not the best guy, but I’m nice enough to help you out. Wronging you is unnecessary.’\n\n‘But you didn’t answer my question.’ Toadstool added. ‘Something must have happened to get you here; tell me–why aren’t you off in some steppe from another world eating bark and salad?’\n\n‘I don’t remember what caused it.’ Blueberry admitted. ‘But I did something. Because of it, my people began to hate me, and after a grassroots trial, they managed to force me out of my hometown.’ He laughed retrospectively. ‘In the end, I don’t even remember how or why, I woke up here once it was over.’\n\n‘Not going to tell me what you did to make them hate you?’ Toadstool asked. ‘But that’s fine, everybody has their secrets.’\n\n‘So what’s yours?’ Blueberry inquired.\n\n‘Hm?’\n\n‘Your story.’\n\nToadstool stared at the wall behind Blueberry. ‘I’m not someone to look up to. End-of.’\n\n‘I’m not asking for your sins. Just, where are you from? What’s your background?’\n\n‘Oh.’ He paused. ‘You know I’m from Amanitaville, like my name says. I have …8… brothers and sisters. I’m from the Clan of the Deer. I sell things.’\n\n‘Like a merchant?’\n\n‘Yes, you could say so. A merchant.’ Toadstool seemed happy with this conclusion. ‘I have family in Amanitaville; I could let you sleep in one of our shelters.’\n\n‘That’s so kind of you!’ Blueberry exclaimed. ‘Thank you… but tell me… Are there people like me in Amanitaville?’\n\n‘Slugfolk?’\n\n‘Yep.’\n\n‘There’s people there. I… don’t actually spend that much time there, I couldn’t say. But–by the sacred will of the Petrified Child–you’ll fit in. Probably.’\n\n‘Petrified what now?’\n\n‘It’s just an old saying. An old god.’\n\nBlueberry shuffled in his seat uncomfortably. The truth set in; he was abandoned, alone, in a world of new gods, new species, and new worlds. He wondered if he would never be able to get used to the world outside of his hometown. He tried to take his mind off of it.\n\n‘So, why did you bring me here, closed off underground?’ Blueberry asked. ‘Because clearly this isn’t Amanitaville. If it were, you’d be a mole rat.’ He jested.\n\n‘Because it’s safe, and I need an enclosed place where I won’t be ambushed. I want to make sure you’re not a spy.’\n\n‘A spy?’\n\nToadstool said nothing and walked over to Blueberry, unlacing the back of his tunic. He inspected the wet skin on the back of his neck. ‘No brand, you’re good. I believe your story, too.’\n\nBlueberry scoffed. ‘Is this normal? Will I have to worry about spies running around?’\n\n‘Only if you’re a “merchant” like me.’ Toadstool chuckled. ‘Let’s just say I have my enemies. Some people want what I sell, and aren’t willing to buy it from me.’\n\n‘Never before have I wanted this much to go home again.’ Blueberry admitted. Toadstool re-tied the lace of Blueberry’s tunic, and stood up.\n\n‘Now I know you’re safe, we’re good to go to Amanitaville.’\n\nBlueberry nodded, and Toadstool picked up his rucksack. He pushed the rock at the entrance out of the way once more, and walking out through the cramped tunnel, they emerged at the surface. The sun shined white through the mid-morning autumnal fog.\n\nBlueberry gasped as his companion took him by the hand, two flat, ethereal appendages appearing out of the mist behind the duo’s backs.\n\n‘What are these?’ He asked, bracing himself.\n\nToadstool looked Blueberry in the eye for a second, pausing. ‘Wings.’\n\nThe two suddenly shot into the air, their wings turning purple, flapping with orange sparks. The fog dispersed as they shot above the surface of the ground, and soon they were both above the canopy. Blueberry could see the entire landscape. The sky, a distant lake, the forest that stretched from horizon to horizon.\n\n‘You can fly?’ Blueberry asked.\n\n‘You can too. Look at you.’ Toadstool unlatched his grip from his hand, and the two wings between them separated into four.\n\nBlueberry was flying, certainly. He could see a purple powdery residue sticking to the hand that was being held, which flared orange and evaporated over time with a tingling sensation. Toadstool gripped his hand once more as the powder ran out and Blueberry lost his balance. The wings merged back into two.\n\n‘This is terrifying.’ Blueberry rigidly uttered.\n\n‘Just relax. We just need to reach the other side of that lake, there my magic will be more stable, and we’ll be able to enter a gateway to Amanitaville.’\n\nBlueberry gulped, trying to control his breathing. The lake approached from the horizon, and as they crossed its shore from above, he felt a great calm take him.\n\n‘Feeling more at ease?’ Toadstool asked. ‘It’s gotta be the scenery.’\n\nBlueberry nervously laughed. ‘Yeah. I’m too used to dry shrubbery. Never seen this much water in one place apart from the oasis at my… home…’\n\n‘Oh darn.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘Well don’t worry. There’s plenty of water over where I’m from. This is only a taster of what’s to come.’\n\nBlueberry was silent.\n\n‘So what did you do to make your people hate you, if you don’t mind my asking?’ Toadstool asked.\n\nBlueberry stared down at the vast surface of the lake, he was on edge, yet calmed by the scenery at the same time. Like a clogged old dam, he couldn’t get the words out. They weren’t there. All memory of what he did to deserve his ostracism was void. His brain panicked, looking for an explanation, but every conclusion it came to felt like a half-baked lie.\n\n‘I don’t-’ He paused. ‘I have no idea. It terrifies me to think about it. I’m scared thinking of what I could have done, and I’m utterly ashamed that I’m unable to feel guilty for it.’\n\nToadstool stared at him contemplatively.\n\nBlueberry continued his monologue. ‘Thank you for your hospitality though. I wouldn’t know where to start in rebuilding a life for myself.’\n\n‘It’s no problem.’ Toadstool responded. ‘I’m really sorry to hear about your situation.’\n\nBlueberry nodded.\n\n‘Stonechild knows some of us wish we could forget our sins.’ He mumbled, almost inaudibly. The sky fell silent apart from the whistle of air past their flight.\n\n‘Lucky for us, our journey will soon be over.’ Toadstool pointed to a peninsula in the lake. ‘That place is stable. We’ll be able to go to Amanitaville there.’\n\nBlueberry was relieved to be out of the air. Once they landed, he took a moment to breathe, reorienting himself, and took a drink from the lake.\n\n‘Dizzy?’ Toadstool asked. ‘That’s normal for people new to the charm of levitation.’\n\n‘Yep.’ Blueberry gagged into the water.\n\n‘I’m just glad you had some prior exposure. You had to have used magic to get here, right? That’s how I knew it was safe. Normally, people native to this realm can't handle it.’\n\nBlueberry frowned. ‘What happens to them?’\n\n‘Stonechild…’ He sighed. ‘It’s horrid. I don’t want to say.’\n\n‘That’s fine.’ Blueberry consoled.\n\nToadstool rubbed his hands together, his palms flaring in sparks. Soon, a large circle began to rip through the fabric of space, its circumference flickering in a spinning circle of orange and purple.\n\n‘This, Blueberry, is how we can travel to my realm, where Amanitaville is.’\n\nBlueberry’s face lit up in a turmeric hue. Staring into the gateway, he could feel something familiar, as if he’d seen one before. His stomach churned looking into the spinning hole.\n\n‘It’s terrifying.’\n\n‘It’s travel.’\n\nToadstool took Blueberry by the hand, marching into the portal. For a second, Blueberry thought he could see the whole world and 6 more, but in the blink of an eye it was forgotten. \n\nOnce reality coalesced, the two were in a new realm.\n\n## Chapter 2\n\n‘Welcome to the 2nd Realm.’ Toadstool exclaimed.\n\nThis place was even stranger than the previous. The trees appeared yellow and red as if it were autumn all-year round, but the air felt as if it were summer. The sky stood pink above the ground, and the canopy was saturated with habitation.\n\nLarge, towering mushrooms littered the scenery, accompanying the trees in their stature. Some of the mushrooms looked like morels, some like agarics, others like boletes and, rarely, like ink-caps.\n\nStepping stones floated in the air, connecting the pathways made of packed clay on the upside of each branch, which ended in dangling shelters that contained beds and stored food and items.\n\nOther people, Minikin just like Toadstool, stood on the branches and on the floor. Some of them on the branches had ropes that held baskets on the end, which others on the ground placed supplies into. The majority, however, opted to transport supplies with the same magic that Toadstool had used earlier.\n\n‘This is Amanitaville?’ Blueberry asked, shaken.\n\n‘That’s right; we were in the 0th Realm before. You likely came from the 1st if you’re one of the Slugfolk.’ Toadstool explained. ‘Thankfully, you won’t have to keep track of all this, given you don’t leave for another realm.’\n\nThe gateway closing behind them, the two walked along the gravel paths built into the ground, Blueberry following Toadstool’s direction.\n\n‘My family’s home is north-west of here.’ Toadstool said, pointing in the direction.\n\nBlueberry felt uneasy. He felt as if the people they walked past were staring, at Toadstool or at himself–maybe at both of them.\n\nThe stares advanced into jeers and growls. It became clear to Blueberry, in a confusing, almost relieving way, that he wasn’t being addressed–it was Toadstool. Blueberry’s eyes darted concernedly from the hecklers to his companion.\n\n‘Thief!’ One voice shouted.\n\nToadstool kept quiet, but it was clear he was thinking.\n\n‘Not looking to buy what you have to sell, careless freak!’ Another shouted.\n\n‘Careless freak?’ Blueberry asked.\n\n‘I told you. I’m not someone to look up to.’\n\nBlueberry held a concerned look at Toadstool.\n\n‘Murderer!’ Someone exclaimed.\n\n‘Murderer?’ Blueberry yelped, stopping in his tracks. Toadstool walked onward, disregarding Blueberry’s repetition of the jeer as if he were to have meant it like everybody else.\n\nHalting after a moment, Toadstool spoke. ‘It’s more complicated than they put on. I’m not a killer, I’m not a murderer–I never laid my hands on anybody.’\n\n‘Explain yourself.’\n\n‘I…’ Toadstool stuttered. ‘I can’t.’\n\nHe continued. ‘But if I were what they said, I wouldn't be helping you. I wouldn’t be doing something good.’\n\nBlueberry said nothing.\n\n‘I’m sorry you have to be here for it.’ Toadstool apologised. ‘Normally they don’t shout like that, but I think they’re just trying to ward you off, to get you away from the “me” they have in their minds.’\n\nBlueberry remained silent, and continued onward.\n\nArriving at the foot of Toadstool’s home tree, Blueberry couldn’t help but stand in awe at the size of it–not only was it very large, but it also bore large morel mushrooms which had been hollowed and converted into living areas.\n\n‘Are you any good at climbing?’\n\n‘No,’ Blueberry explained, ‘I just slip off.’\n\n‘Fortunately, you can rest in one of the morels on the ground.’ Toadstool said, relieving Blueberry. ‘Just go around the tree-trunk.’\n\nBlueberry travelled along the circumference of the tree, attempting not to trip on the thick roots that carpeted the floor. The perimeter of the trunk measured longer than any tree Blueberry had ever seen from his old home; it challenged the width of a giant sequoia.\n\nSoon, he came across a cluster of morels. In the vicinity of each, clay chimineas puffed smoke into the air, and each mushroom was furnished with an orange wooden door and windows that peeked into their large, hulking caps. Outside of each, a network of stepping-stone paths connected each shelter, lit with lanterns of glowing crystal. Blueberry was spoiled with choice.\n\n‘Any one tickle your fancy?’ Toadstool asked.\n\n‘Let me ask first,’ Blueberry inquired, ‘How did you get these mushrooms so big?’\n\n‘They just grow like that around these parts, it’s gotta be the magic. My nation is known as Morelland for the fact that giant morels grow here.’\n\n‘I’ll just take the closest one.’ Blueberry decided.\n\n‘Fair choice.’ Toadstool bowed. ‘As long as you live under my roof, I am to serve you. A custom of the Deer Clan.’\n\n‘I’m flattered!’ Blueberry exclaimed.\n\n‘You can begin by fetching me some leaves to eat.’\n\n‘Oh…’ Toadstool sighed. ‘Not that–it is also a custom that any guests must eat only with the family, from the same reserve of food, so no one gets poisoned. Dinner time is in an hour.’\n\n‘I see. Just leave me be until the time arrives, then.’ Blueberry responded, grasping the front door of his shelter.\n\n‘No doorknob?’ He asked.\n\n‘Oh stonechild, here you go.’ Toadstool rubbed his hands together and opened the door, closing it once Blueberry had entered, with the same flaring magic that he had seen in the gateway and during their flight.\n\n‘Thank you.’\n\n‘It wasn’t a problem. I’m yours to command.’ Toadstool said.\n\nBlueberry made himself comfortable once the door closed behind him. Sitting down on one of the seats, he looked around, noting that the inside of the shelter was a realm in and of itself.\n\nThe walls were decorated with tapestries and the shelves with ornaments and lanterns containing glowing crystals to light the room. The lower room had seats carved into the fungal walls, adorned with blankets and pillows, and the upper room was decorated in the same way, only with the addition of cotton beds. It was accessible with a ladder which had clearly not been used in years.\n\n'Cozy.' he muttered to himself, watching the lights flicker orange and purple.\n\nHe looked for something to preoccupy himself with, and happened across a scroll made of tanned leaves kept closed with a ribbon. The scroll was illuminated with etched drawings beside the text, but Blueberry could not understand the writing.\n\nThe illumination seemed to tell stories of ancient civilisations, deities, and how worship used to be performed thousands of years ago. Blueberry's head tilted as he reached the end of the scroll, however. The images began to tell the story of how a civilisation made a temple to trap a swaddled baby made of rock, and how their empire fell once it couldn't protect them from evil.\n\nHe felt confused inspecting the scroll. The tanned leaf shimmered oddly in the light of the lanterns, and the image of the baby's smile glinted almost comically.\n\n'Where is the moral to this story?' He thought to himself, amused. 'Don't trap babies in temples?'\n\nUnable to take the scroll seriously any longer, he rolled up the leaves, tied the ribbon to close them, and placed them back where he found them. His attention moved to the door, which slowly opened.\n\nThere stood Toadstool, grunting. He was exerting himself as he put his effort into the slow-moving door. He made his way into the shelter, relieved to have opened it. It fell back into place with a soft thud. His eyebrows wobbled without stability.\n\n'Is everything okay?' Blueberry asked.\n\n'Yep.'\n\n'Really? You look upset.'\n\nToadstool paused, looking at the ground, then at the door, and back again.\n\n'Shit.' Toadstool uttered as the door knocked. He held his hand up at the door, bursting magic out of his fingers. A grunt rang out on the other side of the door, and the knocking stopped.\n\n'\"Family and business never meet.\" She said.' Toadstool interjected. 'Fucking liar.'\n\n'WHO?'\n\nThe door blasted open, shards of wood gliding through the air like shrapnel.\n\n'Weaselhunter.' Said the woman in the doorway.\n\n'Really shit timing, Weaze.'\n\n'Really shit goods, Toad.'\n\n'You know what I have to go through. You can't blame me for not finding the highest quality items.'\n\n'What? Last time it was a fool's gold nugget.' She mused. 'What's next? A 0th realm pen lid? And I see - you've picked up a nice, slimy, slugfolk for me.'\n\nWeaselhunter came close to Blueberry; she towered over him.\n\n'What's he for?' She asked.\n\n'I…' Toadstool stuttered.\n\n'You… got him for me? I'm flattered.' She taunted.\n\n'No!' Toadstool exclaimed. 'I saved him… he was lost.'\n\n'Has our favourite mushroom gone even more mushy?' She laughed. 'You've been like this ever since-'\n\nShe was cut off by a loud slap across the snout. Toadstool ran out of the shelter in the blink of an eye.\n\nBlueberry got up, looking Weaselhunter down, and left, looking for Toadstool.\n\nWeaselhunter appeared dumbstruck. Her greying, wiry, brown hair fell to her shoulders, and the rest of her hair was tied up into circular flower-like buns. Her bronze face was punctuated with wrinkles and her toned arms were illustrated with tattoos like the images that Blueberry had seen in the scroll.\n\nBlueberry wandered through the streets of the city, looking for his companion. He could only catch fleeting glimpses of him. Blueberry returned to the place they had entered the realm, and caught his companion before he could leave.\n\n'Where are you going?' Blueberry gasped.\n\n'Back to where I was before.' Toadstool explained. 'Coming back home was a mistake.'\n\n'But you need to spend time with your family.' Blueberry urged.\n\n'And do what? Be abused by onlookers, found by people I \"work for\", reminded of why exactly I can't return?'\n\nBlueberry stayed silent.\n\n'It's not the first dinner I've had without my family. I'll be fine.'\n\n'At least do it for me.' Blueberry responded.\n\n'Huh? What obligation do I have to you?'\n\n'I'm new to this world. I need to experience it. I'd be lost if you weren't here to give me my place.' Blueberry paused. 'And anyway. While I'm not under your roof at the moment, I'm still your guest; you know your customs.'\n\nToadstool looked at the ground, his tail stiff as it pointed toward the floor.\n\n'Dinner is in 30 minutes. I'm going to go for a walk. Don't be late; return to the shelter.'\n\nBlueberry nodded, returning. 'I hope they can use their magic to reform the door.' He thought to himself.\n\n## Chapter 3\n\nToadstool walked into the gateway. Holding his breath, the sparks of magic flared about him as he was transported. In a moment he was taken to the southern hemisphere of the 0th realm; he was in the west. The moonlight gently beamed upon his skin.\n\nHe took a moment to compose himself, shaking sparkling powder out of his hair and off his fingertips. He walked through the tropical grasslands, finding solace in the dark backdrop provided by the wet, green trees and navy sky.\n\nHe continued walking, placing his hand in the air, casting a spell. Recoiling his hand back to his side, he now knew where to go. The charm had oriented him.\n\nSmiling melancholically, he fled through the tall grass. He left behind a trail of disturbed greenery which appeared as if it were waving him goodbye. He methodically made his way to the entrance of a cave.\n\nThe ground seemed to have opened. Its gaping mouth pointed to the sky, welcoming Toadstool into its wet, dark mouth. He slowly glided over its forested lips and into the cavern, and reached the floor in the midst of the darkness that ate up his surroundings like ink.\n\nMaking use of magic once more, he drew a symbol into the palm of his hand with his finger. The symbol ignited with white light. Illuminating the cave, he walked through its natural hallways and nooks, and found an open room in the earth-hole.\n\nHe knew where this was; in fact, it was where he wanted to go, the cavern’s floor was almost completely empty save for stalagmites, moss, lichen, a small plot and a fallen block of stone in the centre. Toadstool walked closer to the plot, and fixed the stone to the plot’s head.\n\nIt was a grave.\n\n‘I’m sorry…’ Toadstool let go, kneeling graveside.\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘I know I’ve said it so many times over.’ He conceded.\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘But I’m trying to be better.’\n\nThe grave said nothing.\n\n‘I’m helping one of the Slugfolk to find a home.’ He admitted in the darkness. ‘I’m helping him live.’\n\nThe gravestone eased its posture. Toadstool perked up excitedly as he watched its response, but it only fell over.\n\n‘Fuck.’\n\nThe damaged block sat pathetically against the cold, wet bedrock.\n\n‘You’re not anything anymore.’ Toadstool snapped; the name on the stone had lost all distinction.\n\n‘I’m crazy for thinking I’ll ever be able to spend time with you again.’ His eyes welled with tears.\n\n‘But what do I expect of you? You’re just a grave.’ He continued, drawing the symbol of rest into the grave’s fluffy soil. The symbol sat on the ground. Toadstool felt as if it looked right to be there. Even if every grave would never open up again, he would still give rest to the lost–if Toadstool could, he’d make sure every grave had the same rest as this one did. Tears flowed onto the ground, watering the soil.\n\n‘I promise…’\n\nThe room echoed with his words, silent apart from them and the dripping of water.\n\n‘I promise to the Petrified Child I’ll leave this life behi-’ Toadstool’s words were cut off by the shout of a woman.\n\n‘You’ll leave what!?’ Weaselhunter cut through the silence.\n\nToadstool jumped.\n\n‘Like that’s true. You still owe me your continued career.’\n\n'How did you find me?' He exclaimed.\n\nWeaselhunter smirked, pausing. 'Our patrols.'\n\n‘What did I even do to deserve this?’ Toadstool screamed, red in the face, rivers flowing from his eyes.\n\n‘You signed up, murderer.’\n\nToadstool yelped, sobbing over the grave. ‘I can’t escape you!’\n\n‘You can’t escape yourself. Your actions. Any other of us would have never let them hurt one of our family. But you–you let it happen. You killed her.’\n\nToadstool continued crying. ‘I know, I know, I know, I’m a murderer!’ He wiped the tears from his face with his scarf.\n\n‘That’s right.’ Weaselhunter encouraged. ‘Stonechild cut you down for it.’ She paused, watching his reaction sadistically, picking back up the conversation with a proposition. ‘But… I need gold from a murderer.’\n\n‘You need it from me?’\n\n‘10 ancient human coins, truly golden. You have a week.’\n\nToadstool didn’t have it in him to say no; his throat locked up before he could get a squeak out. ‘Why not bronze?’ He thought to himself in his silent misery. ‘Why not steel?’\n\nWeaselhunter walked out of the cavern as Toadstool stood, broken, begging and pleading on the inside. Pausing, she said one last thing.\n\n‘Say \"hi\" to your mother for me.’ She shot out of the entrance of the cave in a blink.\n\nAs if he were finally able to pry his mouth open, Toadstool muttered something to himself.\n\n‘Fucker.’\n\n## Chapter 4\n\nToadstool arrived at his home.\n\nFor the first time in what felt as if it were ages, the tree stood familiarly tall over him, but the midday fog drew out its worst features. The winding, bending branches that snaked their way out from the trunk waved unsettlingly in the wind with plumes of golden leaves like flames angrily spitting and sputtering. He tried his hardest to look away from it, but the dangerous, burning fire he imagined in the canopy drew him close as if it were warm.\n\nHe couldn't help but go home again.\n\n'Blueberry!' He called out. 'It's dinner time.'\n\nThe Slugfolk sheepishly came out from his shelter through the newly doorless entrance.\n\n'What's her name… Wease?' Blueberry squeaked.  \n'Weaselhunter?'\n\n'She's your friend?' He asked.\n\nToadstool looked down at the floor, his tail limp and deflated. Blueberry had no answer.\n\n'Dinner is up in the canopy. I'll take you up.'\n\n'Sounds like a plan.'\n\nToadstool took Blueberry by the hand, taking him up with two fluttering wings of purple mist. They droned repeatedly but the duo paid them no mind.\n\nToadstool hoped that the dinner would go well. Having paid a visit to his family earlier, he knew that they'd have prepared a meal for the two. At the canopy, his family were all sitting on a pathway atop a branch.\n\n'What's for dinner?' Toadstool said with childlike glee.\n\n'The children have sweetberries, me and your father have nuts, and you… and your friend… have a tadpole.'\n\nToadstool scoffed. 'A tadpole? For the two of us?'\n\nBlueberry looked at the food, at Toadstool, and at the family. 'I'll have the tail.'\n\n'Does he think this is normal?' Toadstool thought to himself, furrowing his brow. 'Do slugfolk eat tadpoles?'\n\n'Is something wrong?' Said one of Toadstool's young siblings, known as Toad Frog, noticing his expression.\n\n'Stoolie's a picky eater.' Said another of his siblings.\n\nToadstool poked the dead creature which flopped limply on the clay surface of the path. 'Raw?' He asked.\n\n'Of course.' His mother said bluntly.\n\nBlueberry had already begun trying to eat it, his tongue scraping against its tail, but Toadstool wanted to vomit.\n\n'Toadstool's turning green.' Said another child.\n\n'I can't stomach this!' He yelled, kicking the tadpole onto the ground. It hit the ground distantly with a wet thud.\n\nBlueberry jumped. 'You don't want it?'\n\n'I don't know if it's different where you came from, but we don't even eat tadpoles here!' Toadstool growled.\n\n'We eat frogspawn.'\n\n'Good for you.' Toadstool grunted.\n\n'If you don't want to eat what your father and I caught for you, then why are you even here?' Petal jeered.\n\n'Because you're my family!'\n\n'And family means so much to you?'\n\nToadstool's eyes began to well with tears. He tried to admit that yes, he really does care about his family, if only his throat could let anything out in-between his cries.\n\n'Aren't ready to admit you only care about yourself?' She continued.\n\n'He cares about me, right?' Blueberry butted in.\n\n'Shut your mouth, slug.' She said; Blueberry gasped. 'He only helped you out to prove how good a person he is. But the truth is-'\n\nToadstool's claws dug into the pathway. As Petal spoke, he let out a cry. 'I didn't kill her! I didn't even want her to join the Bandits!'\n\n'But you seemed ever so gleeful to know you weren't alone in your profession when she did.' Petal pointed out.\n\n'Who did you kill?' Blueberry muttered.\n\n'Nobody.' Toadstool squeaked. He knew what Petal would say if he were to pause; he took a deep breath in and continued. 'My cousin. Toad Blossom.'\n\n'My niece.' Petal said.\n\n'Cousin Blossie?' another of Toadstool's siblings said.\n\nToadstool wheezed involuntarily. 'Blossie… She joined the bandits. I'm sure she just wanted to be closer to me, right? But I'm not a good person. I don't work to do good things. I work for myself, alone. But I felt so happy to finally have a friend, a cousin, to work alongside; I wasn't alone, until she died.'\n\nPetal herself began to cry. She and her husband's small hands cupped a couple of the childrens' ears. Toadstool let out a tear, and nudged Blueberry to help hide the children from the truth.\n\n'I wasn't even there when they took her from us.’ He emphasised. ‘It was another bandit gang that got to her; she wouldn't give them what they hadn't paid for. She didn’t deserve it, she wasn’t meant for this line of work, and she paid with her life.’\n\nThe pathway fell silent and empty apart from the quiet cries amongst the family and Toadstool's shaky panting. It took a moment for the dialogue to continue once more.\n\n'...If it weren't for you and your Stonechild forsaken job,' Petal said in-between her tears, 'She'd be here eating with us.'\n\nToadstool choked up. Nothing escaped his lips. Looking around, he realised that Blueberry wasn’t there with them. Frog looked up at Toadstool. ‘The slug jumped down.’\n\n‘Stonechild damn the whole thing.’ Toadstool uttered.\n\nToadstool didn’t even glance at his family when he hopped down from the branch in search of Blueberry. ‘I can help you! Blueberry, damn it!’ He called out, his words echoing through the forest.\n\nToadstool knew that Blueberry couldn’t have gone far. Not only was he fragile and soft, but he was also too slimy to climb down. Toadstool frantically searched the lower branches, but it was in vain.\n\n‘I can’t lose another friend!’ He called out.\n\nThe forest began to spin around him as his chest tightened. In the streaks of colour, swiftly blurring around him, he could see a figure on one of the branches. It was dark, shimmery, and had Blueberry’s clothes. It was him.\n\nBefore Toadstool could think, he ran toward his companion; his feet moved faster than his reason.\n\n‘I can’t lose you.’ He panted.\n\n‘You can’t lose me? You don’t know me. If anything, I’m doing you a favour by leaving. This way you can’t kill me.’\n\n‘I wouldn’t kill you!’\n\nBlueberry laughed; the wonder in his eyes had faded. ‘That’s what you said about Blossom.’\n\nToadstool was speechless as Blueberry walked further down the branch. In a blink, he had already consulted a labourer to send him down to the ground on a platform attached to a rope. He was gone.\n\nFrom leagues away, Toadstool watched as his friend grew smaller and smaller in the wooded cityscape as he walked. He probably didn’t even know where he was going; at least until a streetside hag caught his attention.\n\nThe two, like ants, crawled into an alleyway. Having disappeared behind the tree-stumps and organic buildings of the city, the alley flared with the colours of magic. Toadstool threw his hat against the clay beneath his feet. ‘Fuck!’\n\nHe took the opportunity to float down to the ground. Running to the alleyway, an old woman stood alone; one large eye of hers was grey, and her crooked form was draped in rags. Four words scraped out of her mouth like a broken violin.\n\n‘Mossrot sends his regards.’\n\nToadstool’s brow furrowed. ‘Send me to my friend!’ he growled.\n\n‘Oh, to another place you will be reviled?’\n\n‘To my friend.’ He angrily enunciated.\n\n‘To a place you must be changed to enter. Hand over your magic.’\n\nToadstool eased in confusion ‘My… Magic?’\n\n‘You lack the scars of purity.’ She responded, her clawed, thin fingers tracing two bowed scars below her curved ears.\n\nToadstool grunted, standing straight. ‘I see. I’m not giving in, you freak.’\n\nThe woman cackled and spun in amusement. ‘Freak!’\n\n‘Yes!’\n\nShe laughed even harder. ‘Freak! Freak!’\n\nToadstool’s mouth stayed closed, his heart felt as if it were sinking.\n\n‘Freak! Freak! Freak!’\n\nBefore she could repeat it once more, Toadstool had begun to run away.\n\nHe couldn’t stand to remain in the city. This place that once felt like home, years ago, was still hostile and uninviting. Too many people could understand the city, live well within it, but Toadstool never could wrap his mind around how it all worked. It was a mistake to return, a mistake to try to show he wasn’t the murderer, the freak, that people saw him as. He knew that he wasn’t made for that life.\n\nFleeing was always a safe option. Toadstool sighed, relieved to be away from the horror of civilization. His eyes happily adjusted to the sight of less and less people as his legs fluttered away, but as the world reduced to the wilderness, he felt empty. He patted down his pockets, thinking he may have dropped something, but everything was in check. He felt lonely.\n\nIt was the first time he had felt lonely in a long, long time. The last time he had felt like this was when Blossom had died, and since those feelings had faded he’d settled in disdain for his bandit ‘friends,’ his family, and every other person that held him guilty. With Blueberry gone, it felt as if this world was still stubbornly chipping away at his already empty heart. His head bowed in contempt and pity for himself.\n\n‘Koala.’ He muttered, alone. ‘She can help me.’\n\nIf there were anybody who could cheer the bandit up, it was Koala; but Toadstool hadn't seen her in years. He didn't know if she knew, if her home was safe, but he needed hope and faith in destiny—despite how much it had used and abused him for no discernible reason—that there was at least one place he could call home. He hoped that Koala could be that for him.\n\n## Chapter 5\n\n‘Get up.’\n\n‘In an hour… or a year.’\n\n‘For the trees’ sake, Riverbell, get up. You're expected at the town centre by midday.’\n\n‘Midday? Goodness! Blueberry, You should have woken me up sooner.’\n\n‘I did.’\n\nRiverbell sighed, looking up at the ray of sunlight dazzling through the half-eaten leaves above her.\n\n‘What am I needed for?’\n\n‘To arbitrate the latest petition.’\n\n‘Are my people not able to decide for themselves?’\n\n‘That's exactly what they're doing, it was only your father that made it so the sovereign had to give assent.’\n\n‘Don’t mention my father.’","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.088744005Z","tags":["writing","draft","if only"]},"/private/writing/morellic-creation-story":{"title":"The Morellic Creation Story","content":"## Chapter One\nBefore the days of our mothers, before the Lunuth was first planted, and before men and gods drew their first breaths, were all things ordered by the Judges. And the two Judges lived in the forest of Ngwasai Oskaya[^1]. The first Judge was named 'Udrui[^2],' for it brought light to the forest, and the second Judge was named 'Ena[^3],' for it was an attendant in the darkness. And Udrui resided in the east, and Ena the west.\n### The Plants and Waters Created\nNow Udrui would often become tired, and would sleep in the cradle of the eastern horizon, and this would be the night. And in the night, Ena would emerge from the western cradle, to watch over and illumine the forest in the darkness. But the forest was empty, and lacked order, and was only dust. And so, when the two Judges would discuss their concerns, Ena said, 'What is a forest?' But Udrui had no answer, and so they discussed what a forest should be, for they were able to decree such a matter. And so Ena said, 'let stalks and flowers and leaves, all bearing fruit and seeds, to emerge from the dust.' And Udrui made it so, and they emerged, and Udrui named them 'plants.' And the two saw what they had created, that it was good, and they were glad, and ate the fruits of the plants that they had decreed to emerge from the dust.\n\nAnd so, Udrui went into its home, and slept, but the plants withered without the Judge's light. And so Ena was afraid, and cared for the plants. And the Judge created clouds in the sky, that water may fall from them into the ground, and form rivers, and the Judge decreed that the plants should be nourished by the rains and the dust of the ground. And the plants lived, and they were thankful to their creators, and worshipped them. And it came to pass that the plants reached the ends of their lives at the appointed time, and let down their seeds, and their children sprouted from the ground, and ate of the dust of their parents.\n### The Angels and Mountains Created\nThe next day, Udrui emerged from the eastern horizon, and observed the rains that fell from the clouds and the plants that worshipped. But Ena was lonely, and came to Udrui, and said, 'Should we be the only ones to enjoy the forest? Come, let us create angels as companions for ourselves, as a testament to our glory, that they might hold dominion over the forest, and worship us.' And Udrui made it so, and a host of Angels emerged from the ether and began to make garden of the forest. And the Judges saw what they had created, that it was good, and ate fruits with the Angels. And the Angels were glad, and worshipped their creators.\n\nAnd so, Udrui went into its home, and slept, and the Angels tended to the plants in the night and the day, for they were holy in the eyes of the Judges. And the next day, Udrui awoke, and illumined the whole creation. But Ena came to Udrui, and said, 'Is it good that all things should be kept at the same level? For you and I are holy, and yet we share our portion with weeds, and the angels, who are beneath us and above the plants, they share our portion as well. Come, let us create high places for ourselves, and low places for the least holy of the holy things we have created for ourselves.' And so Udrui made it so, and mountains arose from the ground, reaching into the clouds that nourished the plants, for the clouds were holy. And there were left chasms in the surface of the earth, where the water collected, and these became lakes and seas, into which the rivers flowed.\n## Chapter Two\n### Eyolith Menna Corrupts Ena\nNow there was an angel which was unholy in the depths of its heart, and the angel was named 'Eyolith Menna[^4].' And Eyolith Menna hid in the depths of the ocean to hide from all things holy, for it was unholy. But as Ena was walking through the forest in the night, there was a rupture in the seas, and out of this rupture emerged a cloud which carried Eyolith Menna. And the cloud came to Ena, and spoke. 'Peace and favour upon you, my shepherd in the night, my Judge over the forest.' And Ena said, 'Hello, you who are amongst the angels of our creation, what is it you wish to discuss?' Eyolith Menna responded, 'No unholy thing, my creator, only that you give ear to my musings.' And so, Ena said, 'Go on.' And so Eyolith Menna said, 'Do you see it well that Judges and Angels only should enjoy the forest? No, it is no good thing, and I say that it would be a good thing that you should create living spirits, formed of the darkness of the forest, for how will the Angels see you as great if there is no ungreat thing below you?'\n\nBut Ena was not amused, saying, 'Is your method of worshipping me to make me to falter and marr the forest with living creatures of dirt?' And Eyolith Menna said, 'Nay, but to make you to be exalted. For what is one unholy thing when there is already a least holy thing?.' And Ena looked to the ground, saying, 'You are right to say that there is a least holy thing.' And Eyolith Menna said, 'Yes! And what is one more creation to feed upon the least holy things, to praise you, and to stand against you–to prove your greatness?' But Ena was angered, saying, 'Is it your wish to sway my hand from order and greatness? Be away from me, you evil thing.' And Eyolith Menna said nothing, and crawled into the dark places of the forest, and was glad, for it knew it had corrupted Ena's heart.\n### Eyolith Menna is Punished\nAnd so the morning returned, and Udrui returned from the eastern horizon, and was looking over the forest, at all the things that had been made, when it saw Ena kneeling at the foot of the mountains. And so Udrui asked, 'Why are you despondent? Is not the holiness of our creation enough for you?' And Ena said, 'Nay, but I am saddened by the unholy things I heard while you slept.' Udrui said, 'Unholy? There is a least holy thing, but no unholy thing in the forest you and I designed. Are you to suppose we have created an unholy thing?' And Ena said, 'Nay, for we have not created any unholy thing, but I have heard an unholy idea from the one who wished to marr our creation, the angel Eyolith Menna.' and Udrui was angered, and said, 'I will make it that Eyolith Menna is destroyed, and it shall be imprisoned above the clouds, condemned to burn in the night, and to be suffocated in the light of day.' And Ena said nothing, for its heart was corrupted. And so Eyolith Menna was taken and condemned to burn in the night and be suffocated in the light of day, and was the first of the stars which are imprisoned above the clouds, and was the north star.\n### The Spirits of Darkness Created\nBut because Ena's heart was corrupted, it sat in the dark places of the forest, and was shrowded in shadow and the darkness of night. And it decreed, 'I shall take the tar of the forest, and create spirits of the tar, and thus I shall name the spirits, 'Darkness,' for they shall be hidden from the light.' And so the Spirits of Darkness were breathed out from the tar pits, and began to graze upon the forest, and destroy it. And Ena saw what it had created, and was glad, because it was corrupted, and saw them as a testament to the glory of the Judges and the Angels and the Plants. And the next morning, the Spirits of Darkness hid in the dark places of the forest, afraid of the light that had emerged from the eastern horizon with Udrui. And for longer than men have breathed in our time did the Spirits of Darkness live and hide in the dark places where they were formed.\n### The Spirits of Darkness Discovered\nNow the next night the spirits emerged to graze, and destroy, and consume the forest once more, and this they did every moment the light was not exposing their sin, for it was by this destruction that the spirits were fed. But once, as Udrui emerged from the east, and looked over the forest, it was barren, and empty, for the Spirits of Darkness had wholly consumed it. And Udrui was exceeding wroth, and came to Ena, and said, 'What have you done?' But Ena was silent, for it was corrupted. And Udrui said, 'You spoke to me of unholy thoughts of angels in ancient times, and behold! This most unspeakable, this unholy thing has occurred; I see you have been corrupted. Do you think me stupid, that I should not know it was you to cause this? For no dust, no water, no plant, nor any angel could commit such an act of destruction as you have committed this day.'\n### Udrui Murdered\nAnd Ena had no words, but the Spirits of Darkness had a flame of anger ignited from within them. And the Spirits of Darkness emerged from the dark places of the forest, and Udrui was horrified, saying, 'Are you the instruments of my companion's sin?' and the spirits spoke, 'Nay, but we are your companion's heirs.' And Udrui said, 'If you are its heirs, then let you inherit the guilt it gained from lending ear to Eyolith Menna, for you have destroyed the forest in your sin.' And the spirits leaped upon Udrui, and battled it, and the land was overcome by darkness as the spirits murdered their god. And when the battle was done, the burning corpse of the Judge loomed from above the clouds, and there was no life within it.\n## Chapter Three\n### The Aftermath\nUpon this, Ena saw clearly, and it said, 'What have you done?' For it was deeply sorrowful. And Ena said, 'Do you suppose that you should consume me as you have Udrui?' For it was afraid for its own life. And the spirits said, 'Nay, for you created us. The light sought to expose and destroy us, but you lead us in the night.' And Ena was wroth, and said, 'Udrui sought to expose and destroy you not because it was evil, but because you are unholy, and you are the spawn of the machinations of a demon; look up to the north star, and let its fire serve as a reminder to you for the wages of sin.' And the Spirits of Darkness were afraid, and said, 'Surely, you would not burn us as the north star burns.' And Ena said, 'You burn yourselves in your iniquity.'\n### The Spirits of Darkness Given Flesh\nAnd so Ena decreed, 'O, Spirits of Darkness, you shall be imprisoned within bodies of dust and souls of tar, and be subject to the limits of your flesh. Your bodies will be weakened by age, and worn down by the toil that you shall toil under the burning corpse of Udrui, that you should not starve, and thirst, and die. But you certainly shall die, for your appointed time will come, and you will burn amongst the stars, and your fire will only end once the punishment for your iniquity is complete.' And the Spirits of Darkness were given bodies of flesh, and were beasts, and their flesh wept before their lungs first breathed.\n\nAnd the host of beasts looked toward the sky, and with their first breath, spoke as one, 'If we are to die, let our legacy not be cut off forever.' And Ena looked down, and said, 'Aye; I decree that a portion of you be set aside, and, as plants bore seed, you too should bear children, and your children should bear children. But you shall also suffer the agony of labour, as a reminder of your iniquity. And you shall have many husbands, and through them many children, and you shall be queens, with authority over others.'\n### The Realms Shattered\nNow when the Spirits of Darkness had murdered Udrui, the Judge's power was great, and when it died, an energy proceeded from its spirit. And this energy overcame the forest, and warped the laws of nature, and thus the cosmos was so warped that it shattered into a myriad pieces. And once the spirits were given flesh, Ena took the beasts, and put them in the shattered realms, and it sowed new seeds into the barren soil of the realms, and thus emerged new plants. And as the fragments of the body of Udrui flowed overhead to fuel the plants which the beasts consumed, the beasts had children, and their children had children, and it came to pass that they forgot their ancient knowledge, and they knew not how their mothers murdered the sun, and shattered the realms into pieces, and condemned their children to prisons of flesh. And so the beasts had proliferated across the remains of creation, and made for themselves homes upon the planets. And it came to pass that the beasts' children had unfolded into different species, and kinds, and races.\n## Chapter Four\n### The Beasts Forget\nNow the Judge was sorrowful that the beasts had forgotten all things holy, and it said to Qherenna[^5], the angel of dirt, 'have you seen Shinra[^7], whose kind dwells amongst the trees? Let her most favourable husband lie with her, and let the seed sown within her womb be an herald of faith of all things holy, that the beasts should believe and remember through her seed.' And so Qherenna agreed, for it was faithful. And in the land of Kharra-Eyan[^10] lived the woman called Shinra, who was advanced in years, and was barren. And at dusk did Qherenna come to her in a dream, saying, 'Shinra, let it be known to you that you shall be the vessel to carry the seed of faith.' but Shinra said, 'What are you? Have you come to take me in my sleep?' And Qherenna said, 'No, but I am come to show you the will of the Judge. You believe that I am come to take you in your sleep, but I say that you shall be blessed to see your daughter live till the day she is counted among women, then I shall take you.' And Shinra was afraid, and said, 'This cannot be, for you are only a dream; be gone from me!' But Qherenna was upset, and said, 'I rebuke you in the name of Ena the Judge, for we are holy.' And Shinra said, 'you are holy? I have not heard of such beings.' and Qherenna said, 'Yes, and it is for this sake that you shall be the vessel to carry the seed of faith.'\n### Keille is Born\nAnd so Shinra was swayed, her heart was opened. Seeing this, the angel said, 'Shinra, you who are blessed amongst the women of your kind, let it be known that it is Ena's will that you should carry a child, and when this child is born you will name her Eyorna[^8], for she is the seed of which I spoke.' But Shinra said, 'But, holy one, I am advanced in years, and have passed the time of birthing; my progeny is but an empty plain where nothing grows, not even the weeds; I am barren.' And Qherenna, knowing this, said, 'You percieve yourself to be barren, but it is this disbelief that salts the earth of your flesh. Believe in all of the holy things and bring forth your child.' And so Shinra believed, and it came to pass that she laid with her most favourable husband, and was with child. But when the child was born, Shinra was afraid, and said to her husband, 'Surely I will die if this child is to be the seed of faith.' And her husband was unfaithful in his heart, and said, 'Then let us name her not 'Eyorna' as the angel commanded. For if she is not named Eyorna, then you surely will not die upon the day she is counted among women.' And so Shinra named her child 'Keille[^9],' against the commandments of the angel Qherenna and the Judge.\n### Keille's Dream\nAnd so it came to pass that Keille grew in the disbelief of her mother and father, and she was a forager for her family. And the day before she was counted among women, on the last day of the seventh month, it happened that as she laid her head upon the ground to sleep, she was struck with a dream of the angel Qherenna, who said, 'Keille, listen and behold the angel of the dirt upon which you slumber!' And Keille was surprised, for she had not seen an angel till that moment, and said, 'What are you?' And Qherenna said, 'I am Qherenna, an angel amongst the holy ones of the Judge.' and Keille said, 'Have you come to upset my family?' For when any mention of holy things was made, her mother went silent. And Qherenna said, 'Nay, but to bring faith. I tell you that you have been brought up in the falsehood of the disbelief of your mother and father, and I am come to call you to be a prophet.' And Keille said, 'Dare you not to dishonour my mother and father.' But Qherenna said with a loud voice, as thunder, 'they bring their dishonour upon themselves, Eyorna.' And Keille was as if she were struck, and said, 'What is this name, *Eyorna*, that you call me?' And Qherenna said, 'I tell you that this is the name that you ought to have been called, in accordance with what is good in the eyes of the angels and the Judge, for you were sown in the womb of your mother for the purpose of being a seed of faith among your kind.' And Keille said, 'You must teach me of the decrees of the Judge if I am to be a prophet.' And so Qherenna said, 'Yes, and I tell you that before the sun rises in the morning, you will have been shown the decrees of the Judge, and you will truly be the prophet you were made to become.'\n\nAnd so Qherenna disappeared into the dream-ether, and The Judge, Ena, emerged from the darkness. And Keille trembled, for she could not comprehend the vastness and greatness of the moon before her, in her dream. And Ena turned around to face Keille, and it's face was not obscured in shadow, and said, 'do you now see and understand that I, the Judge, am holy?' And Keille said, 'yes,' but she found it difficult to speak, for she was so afraid. And Ena said, 'you find it difficult to speak in my presence, but I tell you that after the sun rises in the morning, I will speak through you, and you will speak well.'\n\n[^1]: *nwasáį oskáya*, meaning 'The First Forest.'\n[^2]: *údrï*, meaning 'The Sun.'\n[^3]: *éną*, meaning 'The Moon.'\n[^4]: *éyolith ménna*, meaning 'The Demon of Life.'\n[^5]: *qherénna,* meaning 'Angel of Kherelh (the Planet),' or 'Angel of Dirt.'\n[^7]: *cinrą,* meaning 'Clay.'\n[^8]: *eyórna*, meaning 'Seed.'\n[^9]: *keillę,* meaning 'Life.'\n[^10]: *khárra eyán*, meaning 'Steppe of the Child.'","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.088744005Z","tags":["writing","lore","mythology"]},"/private/writing/notes-on-the-plot":{"title":"notes on the plot","content":"## Main Characters\n### Blueberry\nName: Blueberry\nSpecies: [Slugfolk](fauna/slugfolk.md)\nAge: Elder\nStatus: Alive\nGender: Neuter (they / it)\nOccupation: High Priest of [Nairu](lore/1st-realm/narra.md)\nResidence: Nairu\n### Toadstool\nName: Toadstool, son of Petal\nSpecies: [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md)\nAge: Young Adult\nStatus: Alive\nGender: Male (he / him)\nOccupation: Bandit\nRelatives:\n\t- Petal (Mother)\n\t- Blossom (Cousin)\nResidence: Amanitra\n### Fern\nName: Fern, daughter of Moss\nSpecies: Minikin\nAge: Adult\nStatus: Alive\nGender: Female (she / her)\nOccupation: High Priestess of [Lütcen](lore/2nd-realm/Liyyena.md)\nRelatives:\n\t- Moss (Father)\n\t- Flora (Mother)\n## Other Characters\n### Moss\nName: Moss\nSpecies: [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md)\nAge: Elder\nStatus: Alive ([Phantasmarrhoeic](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md))\nGender: Male (he / him)\nOccupation: Hermit (current), High Priest of Lütcen (former)\nRelatives:\n\t- Fern (Daughter)\n\t- Flora (Wife)\n### Flora\nName: Flora\nSpecies: [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md)\nAge: Elder\nStatus: Deceased (Murdered by Moss)\nGender: Female (she / her)\nOccupation: High Priestess Consort of Liyyena\nRelatives:\n\t- Fern (Daughter)\n\t- Moss (Husband)\n### Petal\nName: Petal\nSpecies: [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md)\nAge: Adult\nStatus: Alive\nGender: Female (she / her)\nRelatives:\n\t- Toadstool (Son)\n\t- Blossom (Niece)\n### Blossom\nName: Petal\nSpecies: [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md)\nAge: Young Adult\nStatus: Deceased (Murdered by rival bandits)\nGender: Female (she / her)\nOccupation: Bandit\nRelatives:\n\t- Toadstool (Cousin)\n\t- Petal (Aunt)\n## Plot\nThe plot involves a millenia-old prophecy about the end of the world. the cast believe that the end will be brought about by the evil the petrified child is no longer able to destroy, but it is rather the extinction event triggered by it's release. in the end, they choose not to release the child, being the first event in history to have gone against the rigid machinations of fate within their world.\n## Lines to Include\n### Final Line:\nAnd just for a moment, in the brief quiet, the relentless nightmares of fate went out for the very first time.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.088744005Z","tags":[]},"/private/writing/sarvaran-epic-narrative":{"title":"The Sarvaran Epic Narrative","content":"## SCRIPTURA EX MUNDO PRAE ET POST FRACTO\n### Chapter 1\n### The Cosmos Given Shape\nBefore Lunuth had first sprouted, before it had been ground into flour or baked into bread, the [first Judge and the second Judge](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) ruled the cosmos, to give it order. And the second Judge was subordinate to the First, and was not able to decree the laws of nature, for it was a counsellor to the First.\n\nBut the cosmos was destitute, and shapeless. And so the second Judge said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given shape.' Hearing this, the First decreed that the cosmos must be given shape, and from the void emerged dust and water, all of the material of the cosmos.\n\nBut the Judges could not see their creation, and thus the second Judge said, 'we must create a light, so that we may see our creation.' Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that a light may be created, and from the void emerged flames bright enough that they should see their entire creation. And the Judges named this light, 'Sun.'\n\nBut all things were at rest, and without order. And so the second Judge  said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given order.' But the First said, 'this is not a task for us, but for another rank.' And so the First created the [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) to govern the materials of the cosmos, according to the laws of nature. And the Judges contained the laws within an immanent energy throughout all of the cosmos, and named this energy, '[Alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md),' for they had invisioned it.\n\nAnd the Angels had license to decree all things within their dominion, and the Angels looked upon the cosmos, decreeing, 'it is good that the dust and water should collect in lands and seas, and that the lands should collect in planets by the sun, and that the seas should collect in oceans on the planets.' And so the lands collected in planets, and moons, and asteroids, and the seas collected in oceans, which were upon the lands.\n### The Second Judge's Covetousness and the Spirits of Darkness Created\nNow the second Judge was covetous of the first Judge's authority, saying, 'why should my superior and my subordinates decree all things, and I not, but rather to counsel them? Is not the beauty that has been created my own, for I advised its creation?' And so the second Judge hid from the First in secret, and decreed new laws of nature. And the Second contained these laws within an energy incarnate in spirits[^1], and named this energy, 'Darkness,' for it was hidden from the First and the Angels.\n\nAnd the [spirits of Darkness](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) asked the second Judge, 'O glorious, may you please fill us, that we may not be dishonourably hungry, and that our hunger may not dishonour you?' And so the second Judge gave the spirits dust to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, do you mean to dishonour us further? Fill us with something that should match your glory, that we may be a testament to it.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a moon to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, you dishonour yourself if you are to suppose that this matches your glory! Fill us with something greater.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a planet to eat, but the spirits were not filled.\n\nNow the spirits of Darkness did not fear judgement, as they were hidden. Distrusting their creator, they saw it well to consume other things, and thus began to eat other moons, other planets, and to drink seas, till there was nothing left but the Sun, and the Judges, and the Angels. Now the first Judge was horrified by the devestation that had been unleashed by the spirits, saying to its companion, 'why have you created these spirits? Do you not know it dishonours you to destroy the cosmos we gave shape to? I will surely have to destroy these spirits, lest they destroy the cosmos at last.' But the spirits, hearing that they should be destroyed, set themselves against the first Judge, to consume it.\n### the First Judge Destroyed and the Cosmos Shattered\nBut the first Judge and the Angels battled the spirits of Darkness, decreeing that each spirit should be returned to the cosmos as energy and matter. Now the advantage of the spirits was too great, and the Judge could not see them well. And it came to pass that the spirits defeated the Judge, and consumed it. But the power of the first Judge was too great, even in death, and the cosmos and everything within it was [shattered](cosmology/shattering.md), and scattered across many [realms](cosmology/realms.md).\n\nAnd so the surviving spirits of Darkness asked, 'O glorious, are we not now a testament to your glory?' But the Judge was ashamed of the consequences of its actions, and its heart was set against the spirits, saying, 'surely, you will not defeat me as you have consumed my companion.' And the spirits said, 'yes, for you are glorious.' But the Judge wept, saying, 'my companion was right, you were never to be the one testament to my glory, but rather this cosmos of our design. I see now that you lack glory, and your existence will forever shine unfavourably upon me.' And the spirits were afraid, saying, 'do you intend to destroy us?' And the Judge said, 'nay, for I cannot destroy, but I will create a punishment worthy of your iniquity.'\n## Chapter 2\n### New Laws of Nature Decreed and Spirits Given Form\nNow [the Judge](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) resided within the [heavens](cosmology/heavens), which were above and inbetween the [shattered realms](cosmology/realms). And thus it decreed new laws of nature, that the remnants of the cosmos may be protected from further destruction. And the Judge contained the new laws within an energy to replace the energy of Alucinara, and the Judge named this new energy, '[justification](cosmology/justification.md),' for the spirits of Darkness were justified and punished for their iniquity.\n\nAnd so the Judge took the energy of [Alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md), and contained it within crystals, saying, 'the beauty of the old laws of the Angels shall appear from within beautiful crystals.' Also the Judge took the energy of [Darkness](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md), and contained the spirits within bodies of pitch, saying, 'it is befitting that you should be like filth, collecting in the dark places of the earths, for you are deserving of punishment.'\n\nBut the spirits of darkness were unhappy with their bodies, saying, 'we must escape the dark places of the earths.' And so they called out to the [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md), saying, 'are you not unhappy having authority over the dirt? Come, let us create new bodies for us, that you may have authority over something greater.' And so the Angels formed bodies of clay for the spirits, and the spirits of pitch resided within them, and escaped the dark places of the earths.\n### The Spirits Fired into Flesh, Stars, and Kinds\nNow the Judge was upset when it heard of this, saying, 'you have once again commited an act of iniquity against my decree.' But the spirits gloated, and said, 'are you not ashamed? for we have escaped the dark places of the earth, and created new bodies for ourselves greater than any thing you could create.' And the Judge was deeply wroth, saying, 'a false belief has sprouted within you, that you are greater than I, but I say that you inherit your greatness from me. I see that your new bodies are great, for they were created by the Angels, but the Angels are from me.' \n\nBut the spirits of Darkness would not listen, and so the Judge said, 'I decree that your bodies be fired into flesh, that you may toil to consume one another to survive, only to age and perish in the order of your years. And in death, you will burn within the heavens, as stars.' And so the Judge send a flame from the Suns upon the spirits, that they may be fired into flesh, as living beings. And the Judge said, 'I grant you one good thing, that you may bear heirs, and build families, that your legacy is not forgotten, and that the balance of life and death is even, and good.' And so the Judge sent a few spirits down upon the lands and seas, and the rest it kept within the heavens, to burn as stars, and they burn in constellation with one another to this day.\n\nAnd it came to pass that [the living beings](cosmology/living-beings.md) made homes for themselves upon the earths, but some planets were inhospitable. And the living beings were separated in kinds from one another by the Angels, into 'plants,' and 'animals.' And so the plants fed upon the light of suns and were humble, and the animals fed upon all other living beings and were not humble, and so the plants were given many years to live, but the animals were given less. And the Angels also appointed another kind, 'mould', to fulfil the laws of decay and perishing. And another kind, '[people](tags/people)', was set apart from the animals, to be a kind abounding with wisdom and faith.\n### The People Begin to Worship the Angels\nAnd the people were separated into many kinds among themselves. Some were separated from squirrels, called 'Minikin', and some from slugs, and some from apes. But the Judge looked upon the Minikin, and said, 'this kind is good, for they have the means to master the laws of Alucinara and Justification for righteous purposes.' And the Judge said to the Angels, 'come, let us will teach them of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, that they may be made wise in the fear of death and worship me.' And so the Judge and the Angels taught the Minikin of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, and they were wise in the fear of death. And the Minikin were settled in the 2nd realm, within the land of Deshwacath[^2], in the continent of Tseireph. And there the minikin built temples unto the Judge, and worshipped.\n\nBut it came to pass that the Minikin began to worship the Angels, for they could not discern the greatness of the Judge from the greatness of the Angels, for their minds were paltry compared to the celestial beings. And some Angels were evil, and merrymade in the misdirection of worship, and granted the petitions of the misfaithful in return for worship and sacrifice. And so the Judge's heart was deeply afflicted, and it was aggrieved by the false-worship of the angels, and cried out, 'O Angels! How many mistakes must I make before I learn–now I receive no praise, and no worship, for I have made yet another mistake. How it should have been me to die in place of you, O my superior companoon! For I am of lesser character than you, and the world would be exceeding great if I had not I destroyed you in my iniquity.'\n### The Judge Becomes the Petrified Child\nAnd the people heard this in an apparition, and were confused, saying, 'surely our creator has gone insane! It grieves for our faith, yet does not preserve us as the Angels do.' And so the Minikin priests went unto the Judge in the temples, asking, 'are you well?' But the Judge said, 'nay, for my heart is deeply afflicted, I have made another mistake, and the Angels are another testament to my iniquity, and I grieve for my companion, whom I destroyed in my iniquity.' And the Judge said also, 'You misplace your faith toward the mistakes of your creator, but I tell you that it it righteous that you should worship me alone.'\n\nAnd the priests said, 'O creator, how we did not know! Surely, you must atone for your iniquity, for you said to the mothers and fathers of our ancestors that pride is transgression, and yet you do not repent for your own sin.' And the Judge's heart was deeply moved, and the Judge cried out in the temples, 'it behoves me to redeem myself.' And so the Judge lifted its voice to all people in a hallucination, saying, 'I decree that I should be bound by the one duty now to protect the people whom I created an eld ago and punished for their iniquity.'\n\nAnd so the Judge birthed its spirit from itself into an offspring; a child, that it may be humble among people. And the child was to be made of stone, petrified by the Judge's memories of evil, and it was charged with the one duty to protect the people its parent had created. And so the Judge was no more, for its spirit now resided within the child it had become. And the minikin looked upon the child and named it, 'the Petrified Child.'\n### The People Create the Watchstones and Forget the Petrified Child\nNow [the Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md)'s vision was greatly limited, and could not see, and it was not able to protect the Minikin well. And the child came into the temples and said to the priests, 'may you please carve eyes into the rocks for me, that I may see, and protect you?' And so the people carved the eyes into stone, and named them 'watchstones.' The people built watchstones in cliff-faces, boulders, rocks, and pebbles, and kept them as charms within their pockets, that they may be protected from the evil of one another and the beastly kinds of the animals.\n\nBut some minikin were evil, and secretly remained in worship of the Angels, and hid the watchstones. And there were no watchstones in the temples, and in homes, and it was in these places that the people hurt one another, and worshiped false-gods, and were not righteous unto the child, and did not fear it. And so the minikin did not teach their daughters and sons of the child, and died, and their children lacked the inheritence of faith that protected them. And it came to pass as the generations passed that the watchstones were worn down to dust, and were no more.\n## Chapter 3\n### Asthara Chosen by the Angels\nNow in the land of [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) lived a Deshwarite priestess called Asthara, and her husband with her. And it came to pass that in the deep hours of the night, the sinless Angels sent a message in a dream to Asthara, saying, 'you shall have a daughter, and she will bring all of Deshwacath back to true faith. And you will call her name 'Yahna,' for she will be righteous amongst people.' And Asthara was deeply troubled by this, for she had not yet learned of true faith, and it was the custom that priests should not bear children.\n\nAnd so she knelt down in the temple, and brought her soul close to the Angels, asking, 'why have you charged me with motherhood? Do you not recognise my robes as those of a priestess?' and the angel Ceiris[^5], whom was the explainer, spoke out in an apparition, saying, 'Asthara, do not weep! For this is a great task you have been charged with. We see that your heart is good amongst people, and you have been chosen as the progenitor of the slayer of misfaith.' But Asthara was worried, saying, 'tell me you are lying, for I must not have devoted my life to misfaith.' and Ceiris said, 'yea, but it was not in vain. Your misfaith has laid the foundation for the new age of true faith.'\n### The Girl Rescued from the River Morassar\nAnd so Asthara left the temple, and was walking along the river Morassar[^6] to her home, when she saw a baby girl in the waters. And she was greatly surprised, and drew the girl out of the river, but the child was blue, and was not breathing, and so Asthara cast magic, pulling the water from her lungs, and the girl was revitalised. And Asthara asked, 'where are your parents, young girl? May the Angels rebuke whomever hurt you, O precious creation.' But the girl responded, 'I have no parents,' for she was an orphan. And she said, 'I was merely playing alone by the riverbank, and I fell in.' And so Asthara asked, 'do you have a home?' But the girl said, 'nay,' for she could not answer. And Asthara asked also, 'do you have a name?' but the girl could not answer also. And so Asthara took the girl's hand and walked the rest of the way home, and took the girl as her child, calling her 'Perrelim[^7],' for she did not know who she was.\n\nAnd it came to pass after many years that as Asthara laid down in her bed to sleep, Ceiris called out for her in a dream, saying, 'O good priestess! You believe that Perrelim is an ordinary girl, but you have seen that she is exceeding fair and good amongst the Deshwarites, and I tell you that she is in fact Yahna.' And Asthara awoke, and could not sleep, for she understood that the age of true faith was upon her, and she knelt down and said, 'I do not know if I can handle the responsibility.' And Ceiris responded from the heavens, 'be faithful and listen out for the truth from your daughter, and you will be preserved from fear in true understanding.'\n\n[^1]: Sarvaran '*qáyanith*,' meaning 'souls,' or 'pieces of tar,' (*qayą́* / *qayan-* + *-ith* `soul-PL`.)

If I had the means, surely, I would make the travel across Tseireph to our home, but grave events have ensured my continued residence in the hills of *Anqhïrs*. These will be explained in due time, and hopefully unchecked. I have intended to write to you for months ere now. I departed from you and our mother with such determination that I regrettably neglected to mention the reason for my flight. But I have continually read your letters with care and affection, yet without the time nor energy to write back—for all of these faults I am deeply sorry, my dear Milkweed, and I meant no alarm to you nor our mother. For my thoughts have been focussed almost wholly on the subject of my arrival here. That being the *Sharadith*. Those wretched creatures that have dwelt here since before you and I were but a thought in the minds of the Angels, how your heart must pound at their name! But it is not fear that drives me, but rather pity, for it has been my hypothesis that these creatures are not evil beasts, but rather curable men and women, ready to be made whole again, and their minds mended for the benefit of our imperial and holy Matriarchdom.\n\nThis flame within my mind was ignited by the venerable Priest Elkwort. It was during my studies at the grand temple that I learned of the intricacies of the Sharadith, beyond the tales our Mother told us. I was enchanted by the many things I read. How could these creatures enact such evil, without attracting the ire of the Child? Surely if any one of us unafflicted by the curse commited such evil transgressions as murder, or as exsanguination, we should be cast into the earth, and our entire being scattered within the meadows. And yet these detestable beings do such, and are not dealt with so justly. I believe this is for a reason. In the months I spent in the rooms of the temple, I read many scrolls in an endeavour to find this reason. Some of these scrolls were easy to understand, and yet these were worn by the hands of eager students like your brother, and their contents thus known by all who learn in those halls. The more igniting information was kept within those written in more archaic style, their contents obfuscated by the confusion of our tongue. And so I resolved to translate these texts.\n\nElkwort, knowing some of the ancient tongue as it pertains to the liturgy, was able to aid me in this matter. With his help, I was able to learn of the methods by which one might become a *Sharadh*, a process triggered by the consumption of the flesh or blood of a fellowperson. This dark truth shook me to my core as a fatal bell, ringing out upon a funeral, and at points I even considered abandoning my studies. And yet, as if by some unseen force, I was driven ever onward in my studies. I was struck by dreams, nay, nightmares, of what might happen were I to become a Sharadh, and what grave happenstance that would occur to facilitate this becoming. But it is best not to give heed to such thoughts, and the ever returning Sarvaran sunrise over the eastern horizon was fit to cast these apprehensions away into the ether. There was something of the east, even, that intruigued me, of the same species as this unseen force of motivation. Through further studies, it was proven to me by the ancient texts that the east certainly was the source of the Sharadith, that they make their origin in the hills of Anqhïrs, that wretched place in the south of the peninsula to our east. I thought, what significance does this location hold that I might be drawn there? It was now that I had made the decision to leave for Anqhïrs, if only I had made a proper goodbye to you and our mother! Maybe then I should die happy if I were to never see you again. But yet, the prelude to my departure was still some kind of goodbye, if gravely regrettable, and were I to do it all over, I would not have been so brief.\n\nI left for Anqhïrs by wooden carriage, led by a man known by no other name than Bergamot, a diminutive man who suffered from some kind of deformity, a commoner as we are, yet he is amongst the poor of our caste. This was a man who knew no kindness than his own, yet from entering his carriage I felt as if within the company of an old friend, and treated him well. He was delighted to recieve my kindness. I paid him not only with my good company, but also a generous amount of gold to convey me to the dark and fatal corners of Tseireph. It was difficult to tell if his happiness was owed to my generosity or rather his own heart, but it became clear to me that this man was counted amongst the kindest of people, and my heart ached with the knowledge of the place he was dealt within our society. On our journey, we picked up many fellow travellers, but most were surprised to know where I was headed, and weren't headed toward a like destination. Only two of these fleeting souls stayed with me for the remainder of our Journey, that being a priestess known as Hellebore, and a Corothic noblewoman known as Anise. O Milkweed, how I wish you could have met Anise! She shined not only with beauty but also with authority and wisdom. The priestess Hellebore was owed a similar amount of reverence, and yet we were reluctant to do so. She was a bitter woman in spite of her great and respectable service in our society, and following her arrival I found that the moments spent in her slumber were the brightest. However, I discovered that Hellebore came to Anqhïrs with a similar goal to your brother, that she sought to do many works concerning the Sharadith; but her goals differed from mine in that she wished to commune with the Child and the Angels to destroy them, and not cure them.\n\n%% I departed from Sarvara on a wooden carriage led by a diminutive servant man called Acorn, and his 6 draught animals, each with unique and peculiar deformities. It seemed as though the man choked on every word, forcing each sentence out with a cough.\n'To Anqhïrs, sir?' He asked.\n'Aye.'\n'I hear there's Sharadith there. It wouldn't be wise of me to take you without a fee.'\nMy contempt of the ugly man grew with this greedy proposition, but I was obliged to comply with his request, lest I forsake my unseen force, or lead this pitiful man into near-death without fitting payment.\n'Thank you sir, kind sir. I don't suppose you'll wish for any company, sir?' He replied. 'I'll pick up more passengers along the way, sir.'\n\nThe journey itself was that of over a month, and the presence of company was one I desired dearly. We stopped by cities in search of new passengers, but Acorn was laughed at by most, save for by some kind souls. By the midpoint of our journey, we had picked up a couple new friends. The first of the two was a Corothic tradeswoman named Apricot, and the second was a husband of a noble from a land unknown to me, named Bergamot.","lastmodified":"2025-08-24T20:06:45.089743914Z","tags":["writing","prose"]},"/writing/the-sun-grows-dark":{"title":"The Sun Grows Dark","content":"## Sarvaran Text\n*Eyúdhran ikűmma lisi̋nnanis cádra*  \n*kelh ankéiranith liką́rh musápra.*  \n*Oműnith íkų̈ lówerith ánïtirh éyïrath,*  \n*kelh eyán ástïrilh lísï eyápąrath.*\n### Pronunciation\n`eˈjúð.rɐ̃n ɪˈkỹ́.mːɐ lɪˈsɯ̃́.nːɐ̃.nɪs ˈʃád̪.rɐ`  \n`keɬ ɐ̃ŋˈkéi̯.rɐ̃.nɪθ lɪˈkã́r̥ mʊˈsáp.rɐ`  \n`õˈmỹ́.nɪθ ˈí.kʏ̃ ˈló.we.rɪθ ˈã́.nə.t̪ɪr̥ ˈé.jə.rɐθ`  \n`keɬ eˈjã́n ˈás.t̪ə.rɪɬ ˈlí.sə eˈjá.pɐ̃.rɐθ`\n### Translation\nWe watch as the sun grows dark  \nand the time for [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) arrives.  \nWe ponder over all the [Judges](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-judges.md)' works,  \nand give thanks to the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md).\n### Gloss\n`1.PL-watch all.like 3.DEI-darken-INCH sun`  \n`and angel-PL 3.DEI-time 3.SG-arrive`  \n`judge-PL all 3.DEI-work-PL 3.PL-over 1.PL-think`  \n`and child petrify-PAS-STV 3.DEI-to 1.PL-thank`\n## Notes\nSarvaran poetry often pulls off some trickery.
