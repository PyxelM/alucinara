Thus, it can cause changes in movement, temperature, and light intensity.\n\n## Effect on Biology\n### Animals\nMany species take advantage of Alucinara in order to fly, cook food, and stun aggressors.\n\n### Culture\nMany cultures associate Alucinara with their deities. A commonality in Minikin culture is that Alucinara is the physical manifestation of their gods' divinity and influence on reality.\n\nHowever, some cultures may abstain from Alucinara, such as the Morellic Afortuitites.","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/phenomena/baby-meadow":{"title":"Baby Meadow","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/demi-slug":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/dray-mouse":{"title":"Dray Mouse","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/gastropod":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/minikin":{"title":"Minikin","content":"Minikin are the sapient descendents of [0th Realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) squirrels; they reside in the forests, mountains, and steppes of the 2nd Realm.\n\n## Cultures\n- [Morellic](cultures/morellic.md)\n\t- [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md)\n\t\t- [Stonechild Imperial](cultures/morellic/stonechild-imperial.md)\n\t\t\t- [Modern Morellic](cultures/morellic/modern-morellic.md)\n\t- [Dwirivan](cultures/dwirivan.md)\n\t- [Neth](cultures/neth.md)\n- [Snixian](cultures/snixian.md)\n\n## Lifespan\nThe average Minikin lifespan is 30 years, and they reach maturity at 8-12 years of age.\n\nHowever, the Minikin lifespan can be lengthened through Alucinarium exposure.\n\n## Morphology\n### Height\nWhen Minikin are born, they are often 2.5cm to 7.5cm in height.\n\nAt maturity, they often reach a height of 20cm to 30cm.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin eyes are on the front of their head and feature long, bristly eyelashes.\n\nThe colour of the Minikin iris can vary.

They also feature whiskers on their top lips.\n\nHowever, as infants, they feature hair all over their bodies except for their fingers, toes, and face. After the first year, all of this hair is lost.\n\nMinikin hair colour can express itself as brown, beige, grey, ginger, or white.","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/murine":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-rat":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-snail":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-squirrel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/quartz-weasel":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/rat":{"title":"Rat","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/rodent":{"title":"Rodent","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/sea-slug":{"title":"title","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-31T11:05:26.718819045Z","tags":null},"/species/fauna/silkgrub":{"title":"Silkgrub","content":"Silkgrubs, of the family *Dolbaserica*, are small herbivorous insects that produce silk, native to the [2nd Realm](geography/realms/2nd-realm.md).\n\nThey exhibit neoteny in that they often do not metamorphose into adults, rather using the silk meant for their cocoon as shelter-building material, to stay warm and dry.\n\nThey inhabit the [Central Continent](geography/realms/2nd-realm/central-continent.md)'s equatorial rainforest (*Sericifera erucula*), and its many other deciduous forests (*Sericifera foliphagia*).\n\nTheir silk is used for;\n- [Nightsilk](material/fabric/nightsilk.md)\n- [Morellic Drape](material/fabric/morellic-drape.md)\n- [Neth Fleece](material/fabric/neth-fleece.md)\n\nDue to silkgrubs' high populations in forests, the [Morellic](cultures/morellic.md) and [Neth](cultures/neth.md) cultures both often utilise their silk.
