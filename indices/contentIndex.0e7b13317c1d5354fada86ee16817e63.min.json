Thus, it can cause changes in movement, temperature, and light intensity.\n\n## Effect on Biology\n### Animals\nMany species take advantage of Alucinara in order to fly, cook food, and stun aggressors.\n\n### Culture\nMany cultures associate Alucinara with their deities. A commonality in Minikin culture is that Alucinara is the physical manifestation of their gods' divinity and influence on reality.\n\nHowever, some cultures may abstain from Alucinara, such as the Morellic Afortuitites.","lastmodified":"2023-01-10T09:13:41.355480909Z","tags":null},"/phenomena/baby-meadow":{"title":"Baby Meadow","content":"Baby Meadows are a geographic phenomena characterised by increased illness, plant growth, and ecosystemic prosperity.

They also feature whiskers on their top lips.\n\nHowever, as infants, they feature hair all over their bodies except for their fingers, toes, and face.
