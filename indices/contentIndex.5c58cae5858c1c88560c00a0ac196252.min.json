These three elements come together to create a morellic garment.\n## Colour\nThere are many [dyes](materials/dyes.md) to choose from, all of which have different effects on different fabrics. Dyes are not used when tanning. Different dyes are used to create different feelings such as that of opulence, poverty, or occupation.\n## Material\nThere are three most common types of material used in clothing;\n- Firm\n- Elastic\n- Baggy\n### Firm\nFirm materials are those like tanned leaves, thick fabric, or leather. They are usually very firm, thick, dark, and are used in pieces such as the waist-belt and tunic. They are usually made out of animal hide, felt, or longleaf.\n### Elastic\nElastic material is self-explanatory; it is soft fabric that stretches. It is commonly used in places where stretching is common, such as the cuffs, waistband, and undershirt. They are commonly made out of fibres such as silk.\n### Baggy\nBaggy material is also fabric; it is generally pleated or draped over the body. They are generally created out of plant fibres such as flax or linen.\n## Shape\nThere are many shapes that are indicative of a morellic garment. These are:\n- Bell-shaped openings\n- Tunics or Capes that cross over themselves in an X shape over the chest area.\n- Shoes that protect the toes and wrap the rest of the foot in a spiral.\n### Tunic\nThe tunics on morellic clothing are characterised by their cross-shaped overlap placed over the chest. This not only gives customisability as for how much skin to show around the neck, but also creates a pleasing V-neck shaped design. The tunic is commonly made out of firm material.\n\nThis cross-shaped overlap is created by using a long piece of material which is draped over the shoulders, overlapped, and tucked into the waist-belt. Sometimes, some additions are made, such as;\n- Pins\n- Buttons\n- Straps\n- Laces\n#### Pins\nIn the case of pins, a circular or oblong pin is used to fasten the upper layer to the lower layer. These pins, similar to safety pins, are often decorated with cute pictures, symbols, and designs, and help the overlap to stay in place. One to three is the usual amount of pins used.\n#### Buttons\nSimilar to pins, buttons are also decorated with symbols or pictures. They are sewn into the lower layer's side of the tunic,  and are fed into holes on the other side, in order to make sure that the overlap does not come undone.\n#### Straps\nThe use of straps is less common, but is standard for active, athletic, or bandit minikin. They are used with non-overlapped tunics, ones which do not have an X-shape but simply ride down the shoulders leaving a gap in between.\n\nStraps are used to customise the length of the gap. Keeping the V-neck design, they are used to bring the sides of the tunic together, leaving little to no gap. There is usually no more than 1 strap used, if any.\n#### Laces\nLaces are used in a similar way to straps, only using a string to tie the gap closed on non-overlapping tunics. The laces are often fed through multiple holes and are tied into intricate symbols or designs.\n### Waist-Belt\nThe waist belt is a ubiquitous aspect of morellic clothing. Their thickness can vary from thin to wide. Thin belts feature a buckle simply to do its job, but wider belts can feature symbols or designs on their buckles, such as metal engravings.\n\nWaist belts are commonly made out of leather or tanned leaves, are placed atop the waistband which the undershirt is tucked into. Sometimes, patterns are scored into the belts, such as concentric lines or diagonal repeating lines.\n### Undershirt\nThe undershirt is made up of two parts - the sleeves, and the body section. The undershirt is generally made out of elastic material and features a simple overlapping shape.\n\nThere is no gap in the centre of some undershirts, in which case the overlap is sewn into the bottom of the undershirt and buttons are optionally added. In undershirts with a gap, the gap is closed using lace, which also has many holes to be fed through and tied into intricate shapes.\n### Sleeves\nSleeves are the visible portion of the undershirt, and are made from baggy material. They may be short, or go down to the wrist; they are bell shaped, flaring with pleats which are sewn closed at the end of the sleeves. At the end, one may add a cuff, or may forgo this option. There are many cuff designs:\n- Tube Cuff\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### Tube Cuff\nThe tube cuff is named for its cylindrical shape. It is simply a tube attached to the end of the sleeve, close to skin-tight. They generally have two straps at their beginning and end to customise their circumference, although some only have one strap at the end.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff is similar to the tube cuff, only it doesn't go in a tube shape for does it stay close to the skin. Rather, it flares outward in a waving ruffled pattern. The length of this cuff can vary from short to very long in some cases, but it never exceeds past the hand when fit correctly.\n#### No Cuff\nNo cuff simply means that the sleeve ends when the pleats are sewn together, with no continuation. This option is uncommon for arm sleeves, and is usually taken when a cuff is too expensive to add; it is a cultural indicator of poverty.\n### Trousers\nTrousers can be calf-length or longer, but never end any further than the ankle. They are similarly bell-shaped with pleats, like sleeves, but have different customs for their waistband and cuffs.\n- Ruffled Cuff\n- No Cuff\n#### No Cuff\nUnlike arm-sleeves, no cuffs on trousers is much less frowned upon. It is largely the norm for trousers.\n#### Ruffled Cuff\nThe ruffled cuff on trousers is always very short. It serves as a fashion decoration to demonstrate wealth or romantic favourability.\n#### Waistband\nIn addition, the waistband of morellic clothing is always very important. It is connected to the rest of the trousers, and is usually reinforced with a stretchy, elastic material. The undershirt is tucked into the trousers and the waist-belt is put atop the waistband, helping comfortability.\n### Shoes\nMorellic shoes are the most alien to humans. Due to their digitigrade feet, they feature small soles and long heels. Sometimes, shoes are simply not worn. The appearance of morellic shoes can vary from boots to glorified socks. There are two sections:\n- The toe section\n- The heel section\nSometimes, when the toe section is missed out, the heel section continues to the end of the foot, leaving the toes exposed, and a soft insole is tucked in between the soles and the fabric.\n#### Toe Section\nThe toe section has a firm dome that covers the upper side of the toes, and a hard underside that protects the soles from harm. Sometimes, the firm dome and hard underside are simply missed out; this is a sign of poverty. They are lined with a soft insole.\n#### Heel Section\nThe heel section is relatively simple, it is just a piece of fabric connected to the toe section that wraps around the heel as if it were a bandage. The heel section is often tucked into the trousers.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["minikin","morellic","clothing"]},"/cosmology/alucinara":{"title":"Alucinara Energy","content":"## Overview\nAlucinara, also known as magic, is a form of energy that alters the ways in which the natural world can operate. It does this by altering the laws of nature in its vacinity from the third laws of nature to the first. It was created by the [first Judge](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md), in the form of the first laws of nature.\n## Appearance\nThe energy lacks an appearance, but is physically contained within the crystalline mineral of alucium. Alucium is dusty, brittle, dark purple, and shines bright orange, emitting bright orange specks, orbs, and flashes of light when disturbed.\n## Origins\nAlucinara energy originates as the emminent energy that facilitated the first laws of nature, which were created by the first Judge. When the realms were shattered by the [spirits of darkness](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) and the first was destroyed, new emminent laws of nature were decreed by the second Judge to punish the spirits, but Alucinara was kept, and given physical form in the element of alucium (as were the spirits given physical form in hydrocarbons).\n## Biology\nThe presence of Alucinara on living beings has many effects, such as; the development of the fortuitary gland, where alucium is excreted into the bloodstream for use, and the manipulation of evolution in unexpected and fantastical ways.\n## Uses\nIt can be used to overcome the physical world through processes such as levitation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, hydrokinesis, energy medicine, and prophecy. It can also be used to contact deities through processes such as astral projection, dreams, and visions.\n### Examples\nSarqitwara fruit use Alucinara energy to emit bright flashes of light when disturbed as a biological process and defence mechanism when unripe. Similarly, Sapient species use Alucinara energy for many things, including to cook food and manipulate objects from afar.\n## Cultural Significance\nAlucinara is heavily culturally significant to virtually all cultures outside of the 0th realm, due to its fantastical and strange effects, especially how it can be used to contact incorporeal spirits. It is used in the rituals of some Minikin cultures as a way of speaking to gods.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["alucinara","cosmology"]},"/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels":{"title":"The Angels","content":"## Overview\nThe angels are celestial beings created by the [Judges](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) to govern the elements of the cosmos. They are worshipped as parts of the pantheons of many Minikin cultures, and can be communicated with through dreams, visions, and [prayer](cosmology/prayer.md).\n\nThey differ from the Judges, who gave order to the cosmos, and so are a separate class from the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), who descended from the second Judge, despite all being deities or celestial beings.\n## Behaviour\nThe angels govern the natural elements, decreeing the processes they take according to the results they desire. In addition, they do favours for living beings in return for worship and sacrifice. For example, many people may call upon the angel of rain during a drought, and in return for their reverence it will alleviate their thirst.\n\nFurthermore, they are incorporeal, and are only accessible to interact with through dreams and visions triggered by [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) and hallucinogenic substances, which are commonly an important feature of many religions.\n## Notable Angels:\n - Qherel'li[^1], the nature mother\n - Qeirįs, the explainer\n\n[^1]: Using the angels' Sarvaran names; also appears as 'Kherelli' in Old Sarvaran.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["cosmology","deities","the-angels"]},"/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges":{"title":"The Judges","content":"## Overview\nThe Judges are the two celestial beings from the beginning of the cosmos who created the universe, the spirits of darkness, and the [angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md). The first Judge's duty was to decree all of the laws of nature, and the second's duty to counsel the first. However, the first judge was destroyed by the spirits of darkness, and the second Judge survived, becoming the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md) out of guilt.\n## The Spirits of Darkness\nHowever, the second grew jealous, and created the spirits of darkness, which consumed the matter of the universe in their hunger, and they destroyed the first Judge in an act that triggered the shattering of the realms.\n## Alucinara Energy\n[Alucinara Energy](cosmology/alucinara.md) is the name given to the energy that houses the first laws of nature, which were overruled by the second Judge after the shattering of the realms. Alucinara energy still exists after the shattering, but is not emminent as it once was, and now inhabits the physical form of alucium, a crystalline mineral.\n## The Petrified Child\nDue to the second Judge's guilt over the death of the first, it humbled itself to become the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md) and charged itself with the task of destroying evil, so that no more celestials mistakes might be made like they were before.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["cosmology","deities","the-judges"]},"/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child":{"title":"The Petrified Child","content":"## Overview\nThe Petrified Child is a semi-corporeal deity which is worshipped by many minikin groups, including the [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin) minikin. The child's duty is to destroy all evil according to its own moral code, protecting the cosmos[^1] from any living being who wishes to desecrate it. The child inherits its existence from the [second Judge](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md), serving as its successor and continuation.\n## Appearance\nThe Petrified Child has the appearance of a swaddled infant made from stone, and is very large, about 5 metres in length. Its body has a smooth, bean-like, inverse-teardrop shape, and its face is round, with [minikin](fauna/minikin.md)-like features, and eyes which are forever closed. Its body is also defined by swirling creases (A result of the effects of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) on physical matter) which resemble folds of cloth.\n\n![](images/the-petrified-child.png)\n## Behaviour\nThe Petrified Child hovers above the ground, levitating smoothly through space. It is semi-corporeal, meaning that it is not always in physical manifestation, but it is able to manifest in any realm and location.\n\nAs the child's eyes are always closed, it sees through the use of [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md), which are eye-shapes formed or carved into stone, appearing all across the realms. Some groups hide from Watchstones in order to commit acts the Child would usually consider evil, such as war, grand theft, murder, and betrayal.\n## Destruction of Evil\nThe Petrified child is tasked with the one duty to destroy evil. Its moral code is marred by its childlike mind, but is chiefly concerned with the preservation of the natural and holy world from disorderly beings. Thus are the actions the child considers evil:\n- Disrespect of nature, including large-scale zoocide and ecological destruction.\n- Disrespect of celestial beings, including violence and utterance of curses or insults in their presence. \n- Disrespect of other living beings, including murder and flagrant transgression of sacred taboos.\n\nAs the celestial beings are unable to destroy matter outright, the child rather opts to turn the purpetrators of evil into a substance known as Baby Sludge. Bones and teeth are unable to be turned into the sludge, as they are made of inorganic matter.\n### Baby Sludge\nThe sludge is a highly effective fertilizer, and serves to aid the proliferation of ecosystems over time. However, it is also highly deadly to animals, as it aids not only the growth of plant matter but also biophagous and necrophagous pathogens and fungi.\n### Baby Meadows\nMain Article: [Baby Meadows](phenomena/baby-meadows.md)\n\nBaby meadows are the result of baby sludge's effects on the natural world. They are small, lush areas of increased proliferation and biodiversity, often about 10 metres in diameter. They are commonly marked by the bones of beings that were destroyed by the child or that came into contact with the sludge and perished soon after.\n\nBaby meadows are feared and avoided shortly after formation, due to the adverse effects of baby sludge sludge on animals. However, baby meadows may be inhabited long after formation, once all of the sludge has dissipated, and are a choice location for inhabitation by many groups.\n\n[^1]: The order of the natural and holy world; including the integrity of ecosystems, respect of other living beings, and due reverence of celestial beings such as the child and the angels.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["cosmology","deities","the-petrified-child","the-judges"]},"/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness":{"title":"The Spirits of Darkness","content":"## Overview\nThe spirits of darkness are celestial beings that were created by the [second Judge](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) behind the first's back out of jealousy for the first's superiority. They are made out of the energy of Darkness, and eventually became the souls of living beings, inhabiting the organic matter within their bodies (as [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) inhabits alucium).\n## Background\nThe spirits of darkness, created by the second judge and hidden, were afflicted by great hunger from their begining and resolved to consume the entirety of the universe's matter. Once this was complete, the spirits attempted to consume the first Judge, but destroyed it in an act that triggered the shattering of the realms.\n\nThey were punished by the second Judge to have physical form, taking the form of hydrocarbons, as in tar and organic matter. They eventually developed to inhabit greater carbon-based bodies of flesh, but these bodies were also punished to decay and die over time for what the spirits had done.\n## Behaviour\nIn the present, the spirits of darkness act as a form of energy that inhabits the organic compounds within living beings' bodies, making up their soul. Memories are contained within the spirits of darkness, but are lost once a soul is permanently disconnected from the physical world upon death.\n\nHowever, they can inhabit other vessels after their living body perishes. For example, shortly after death, some minikin groups contain the soul of their loved ones within [soulstones](phenomena/soulstone.md), which are ornamental or ceremonial objects made from asphalt.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["cosmology","darkness"]},"/fauna/2nd-realm-fauna":{"title":"Fauna of the Second Realm","content":"## Minikin\n[Minikin](fauna/minikin.md) are a sapient rodent species native to the 2nd realm. They are descended from the European Red Squirrel, with a lifespan of 12-18 years, reaching maturity around 8 years of age.\n\nThey and grew to become the most populous intelligent race of the 2nd Realm, and are capable of speech, agriculture, forming civilisations, among all of the other skills and industries that come with them.\n### Appearance\nThey are about 25-35cm in height, and are largely hairless besides their tails, noses, hands, and feet when mature, losing during adolescence the furry coats they are born with.\n### Sociology\nEarly Minikin groups were nomadic foragers and hunter-gatherers, living in familial clans which were united in tribes, united in cultures, united in races. Later Minikin groups settled down in arboreal cities, forming city states and, even later, nation states.\n### Diet\nMinikin are mostly herbivores, consuming fruits, nuts, leaves, vegetables, and treebark. Due to other forces, such as the development of cooking technology or food scarcity, Minikin also eat various forms of bread such as Lunuth bread, dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, and alcoholic drinks such as beer and fruit wine.\n## Bushdeer\n[Bushdeer](fauna/bushdeer.md) are a ruminant species native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They are related to Earth deer, with the major differences being their tree-like antlers, distinct white stripes on their sides, and skull-like white markings on their faces.\n### Diet\nBushdeer are herbivorous, their main source of food being leaves and moss. They sometimes eat other foods, such as algae, fungi, and small animals.\n### Antlers\nTheir antlers, their most striking feature, exhibit robust, vascularised, green pseudo-leaves; these leaves contain chloroplasts taken from the various photosynthetic organisms in the bushdeer's diets, and provide the animal with an extra source of energy.\n### Play-Dead Reflex\nWhen bushdeer undergo the instinctual play-dead reflex, the rib-like stripes and skull-like facial markings help to mask their bodies from predators, giving the impression that they have already been fully scavenged and begun to rot.\n## Pygmy Bushdeer\nPygmy bushdeer are a part-arboreal, smaller version of common bushdeer. They are venerated by the Morellic minikin as sacred animals, and are thus forbidden to be killed in Morellic culture.\n### Use\nThey are used as mounts by some Minikin cultures, including the Morellic, who ride them during religious ceremonies and pilgrimages. Other nomadic cultures ride them to find new areas for their livestock to graze.\n## Wooly Hogs\n[Wooly hogs](fauna/wooly-hogs.md) are a species native to the 2nd realm which are related to, and resemble, the wild boars of earth. They are small and farmed for their wool and pork.\n### Appearance\nThey are about 25 cm in height when mature, but are proportionately bulky. They feature a large, long head, humped shoulders, small hind end, short legs, and characteristic long, curly fur.\n### Use\nThey are farmed by some Minikin cultures for their robust wool and nutricious pork, and are sometimes ridden or yoked. In order to remove parasites from their flesh, they are cooked, and it is considered taboo to eat their pork raw.\n\nAmong Morellic hunter minikin, it is said that it is good luck to cleanly cut a wild Wooly Hog's tail off, and bad luck to fail to do this. These tails are often kept as trophies by hunters, and appear in heraldry as a symbol of good skill.\n## Dragons\n[Dragons](fauna/dragons.md) are a small amphibious species native to the 2nd, 3rd, and -2nd realms. They are omnivorous, consuming berries and insects, and come in many varieties, each differing in colour. Dragons are inedible but are hunted and used in the making of dyes.\n## Snoutgoats\n[Snoutgoats](fauna/snoutgoats.md), also known as Yuriqith (Plural) / Yuriqh (Singular), are a goat species native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They are half a metre tall, with fur that ranges from light beige to brown.\n\nSome Minikin groups farm or hunt Snoutgoats, utilising their meat, milk, fur, sinew, and dung for food, dairy, clothing, tools, and fuel. Some groups mount snoutgoats, riding them for transport.\n## Rat Monkeys\n[Rat monkeys](fauna/rat-monkeys.md) are an arboreal monkey species native to the 2nd and -1st realms, the only monkey species native to Tséireph below the equatorial rainforest. They are small, similar to squirrels in size and habitat, and eat nuts, leaves, and various small animals. They are hunted by some Minikin cultures, such as the early Sarvaran minikin.\n## Pack Snails\nPack snails are a gastropod species native to the 2nd realm. They are large, about the same height as Minikin from their foot to the top of their shells. Their diet consists of leaves and vegetables.\n### Use\nThey are used by some Minikin cultures to transport goods such as spices and grains, in which case their shells are fitted with a saddle and utility belts featuring tools and cargo pouches, travelling in often guarded caravans headed by merchants.\n## Widrens\n\n## Darkmoths\n\n## Oomi Silkworms\n\n## Weasels\n\n### Cavalry Weasels\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["fauna","second-realm"]},"/fauna/bushdeer":{"title":"Bushdeer","content":"## Overview\nBushdeer (Type Species spp. *Floricervus Floricervus*), native to the steppes of the 2nd and -1st realms, are a type of deer related to the Sika deer of Earth. They are herbivores and browsers, consuming leaves and moss. The most striking difference is their antlers, which feature 'leaves.'\n## Origins\nAt first, the descendents of Sika deer which had undergone essential shift began to experience swift evolution due to the effects of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) on their bodies. One of these changes was the development of folate, vascularised protrusions on their antlers.\n\nThese 'leaves' initially served as areas for heat exchange in the steppes. However, due to the increased consumption of photosynthetic organisms aided by the new ecosystem they had found themselves in, these 'leaves' began to also serve as dumps for chlorophytes, which the deer couldn't metabolise.\n## Appearance\nBushdeer appear brown, white, and black. Their leaves can vary from green to yellow to pink depending on their diets. Their sides are painted with long, white, vertical streaks, reselving ribs, and their tops feature dappled white spots.\n## Behaviour\nWhen under threat, they undergo the reflex to go limp and play dead. This is aided by their ribcage-esque fur patterns, which make them appear to be rotting and already scavenged.\n## Cultural Significance\nThe arboreal bushdeer (spp. *Floricervus arborealis*), a dwarfish relative to the common bushdeer native to the forests of Tséireph, is seen as sacred by the Morellic minikin, who collect their antlers when they are dropped. These antlers are generally put on display or ground into a powder for medicinal purposes.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["fauna","deer"]},"/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDemi-Slugs (spp. *Arion homunculus*) are a nomadic sapient gastropod species native to the 1st realm. They are herbivores, eating leaves and soft plant tissue. They live in societies built around the ceremonial and survivalistic foraging of plants and defense from other animals.\n\n## Adaptations\nAfter the Supernova of 80MB, a great portion of slugs were shifted into the 1st realm. These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with Alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [alucium](cosmology/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to alucium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["fauna","people"]},"/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"## Overview\nDragons are a diminutive amphibian species native to the wetlands of the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md), 3rd, and -2nd realms.

Airborne varieties exhibit wing-like apparitions above their shoulders when in flight.\n\nWater Dragons are a watery green colour, Earth Dragons brown, Wind Dragons blue countershaded with white on their undersides, Fire Dragons orange, Magic Dragons an aluciferous purple, and Electric dragons yellow.\n## Life Cycle\nDragons lay their spawn in damp, wet, areas, such as ponds. Their eggs are mainly found in wet climates, such as rainforests, but it is not uncommon for them to migrate elsewhere later in life.\n\nThey begin life in a tadpole-like nymph phase in which they live in their ponds and feed upon plant matter, eventually maturing, growing their limbs, opening their eyes, and leaving the water for the first time.\n\nTheir adult phase is around a few years long; they travel over vast distances in search of food and a mate, eventually returning to their birthplace to lay their own eggs, before they pass away soon after.\n## Uses\nDragons are mostly poisonous, if not unpalatable, and are thus not eaten by most groups. However, they are hunted and harvested into dyes by many [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) cultures.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["fauna","amphibians"]},"/fauna/minikin":{"title":"Minikin","content":"## Overview\nMinikin (spp. *Anthrosciurus sapiens*) are a small rodent species native to the [2nd Realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). They are arboreal omnivores which tend toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They are capable of language, and appear anthropoid.\n\n## Adaptation\nMany red squirrels that had found themselves in the [2nd Realm](lore/2nd-realm.md) as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and are subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;\n- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,\n- greater agility and capacity for stealth,\n- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.\n\n## Morphology\nMinikin measure at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same Alucinara that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Morellic Race\n\n### Austerkin Race\nThe Austerkin are a lot hairier compared to other minikin races.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution can vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tends to have hair, and the tail is fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin are almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin are hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour can vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour can vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucium](cosmology/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tend to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's den(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or dens.\n\nModern minikin groups inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees are often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commits a crime, they are ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails are seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and disconnection from the soul is representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' can vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group is too large for one community, it inevitably collapses. A varying amount of groups form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups are often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucium secretion and essential shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, are greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernate in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin become unconscious in a sleep-like state, and alucium levels in the brain increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protect the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis is not seen in normal sleep, but is shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucium in the brain during hibernation is a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["fauna","people"]},"/flora/2nd-realm-flora":{"title":"Flora of the Second Realm","content":"## Nyuta Bushes\nNyuta bushes are a type of bush native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have red leaves and purple berries. Nyuta leaves are dried and consumed in a purple tea by many [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) cultures.\n### Nyutaberries\nNyutaberries are small, edible, and purple. They have pink stems and near-white mesocarps which contain many small black seeds. They are foraged by some Minikin cultures.\n### Nyuta Tea\nNyuta tea is favoured for its hallucinogenic effects when consumed in large quantities, leading the drink to have a lot of spiritual significance to some cultures. However, a drink or two won't hurt.\n## Sarqitwara Trees\nSarqitwara trees are a type of citron tree native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have yellow leaves and orange, segmented fruit.\n### Sarqitwara\nSarqitwara themselves are the plants' segemented orange fruits. Their segments can be removed whole, and individually peeled, revealing a pithy orange-like flesh, with large black seeds within.\n\nWhen unripe, the fruit releases flashes of light when disturbed, through the use of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md). This is to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat the fruit before it is ready to germinate.\n\nWild Sarqitwara are foraged by some minikin cultures, and some varieties were domesticated, such as the Morellic Sarqitwara, which began to be cultivated in orchards by the Sarvaran minikin.\n### Pelen\nPelen is a plant native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They are similar to carrot plants, only with larger, wider, red roots, and are farmed by many Minikin cultures.\n### Pelenroots\nPelenroots are the large root vegetable of the Pelen plant. They are large, wide, and feature a deep red hue. They are eaten by many minikin cultures and are typically boiled before consumption.\n### Pelen Leaves\nPelen Leaves are the leaves of the Pelen plant. They are large, green, and edible. They are eaten by some minikin cultures, using them similar to lettuce.\n### Pelen Red\nPelen Red is a dye engineered by the Sarvaran minikin, taken from the deep red colour of Pelenroots, which get their colour from high concentrations of betanin and carotene. \n## Lunaflower Plants\nLunaflower plants are native to the 2nd and -3rd realms. They feature delicate purple flowers.\n### Lunaflowers\nLunaflowers have purple and pink petals, with a moon-like white centre where many sub-flowers and their seeds are kept, like sunflowers of Earth. It is foraged by some minikin cultures, eaten on their own, and pressed into Lunaflower oil.\n### Lunaflower Oil\nLunaflower oil is transparent and pink. It is squeezed out of Lunaflowers and used in many situations, including anointing, cooking, and lubrication.\n## Lunuth Wheat\nLunuth wheat is a grass native to the 2nd realm. It is the domesticated version of Lunuth wildgrass, and was one of the first plants to be farmed by the early Sarvaran civilisation.\n### Lunuth Grains\nLunuth wheat produces small grains with hard, purple hulls. These grains are typically ground into light pink lunuth flour, or pressed into crimson lunuth oil.\n### Lunuth Bread\nLunuth bread has been a staple food of many minikin cultures, even non-agricultural groups. It has a slight purple hue beside from being mainly beige and brown. It is typically leavened, sprinkled with Nyuta seeds, and eaten with lunaflower oil.\n### Lunuth-based Textiles\nAs well as being able to be turned into bread, Lunuth is farmed by some minikin cultures for it's long, flax-like fibres, which are turned into thread or woven into Lunuth fabric. In some regions of Qherell, Lunuth was the first plant to be used in textiles, revolutionising the craft for the Sarvaran Civilisation.\n## Aqhoran Rice Plants\n\n### Aqhoran White Rice\n\n## Glowpear Trees\nGlowpear trees are a type of tree native to the 2nd and -1st realms. Their leaves are deep green and their fruit are glowing blue. They are grown in orchards by some Minikin cultures.\n### Glowpears\nGlowpears are the fruit of the glowpear tree. They are similar to pears, with the main difference being their luminous, vibrant blue-cyan colour. Their juice similarly glows, owing to the presence of [alucium](cosmology/alucinara.md). They are sometimes foraged by some Minikin cultures.\n### Glowpear Leaves\nGlowpear Leaves are the leaves of the glowpear tree. They are shiny, with a deep green complexion. They are inedible to Minikin, but serve as a vital food source for herbivorous livestock such as bushdeer, wooly hogs, and pack-snails.\n## Dreamberry Bushes\nDreamberry bushes are a plant native to the 2nd and 1st realms similar to raspberry plants. They feature long, creeping branches with small green leaves and sharp thorns.\n### Dreamberries\nDreamberries are small berries similar to cloudberries which range in colour from orange to pink depending on variety. They are foraged and eaten by some minikin cultures, making up a large part of their diets.\n### Dreamberry Jam\nDreamberry jam is a jam made out of Dreamberries. It was first invented by the Sarvaran minikin, whom ate it alone or spread on or inside of Lunuth bread loaves, sandwiches, or baguettes.\n### Dreamberry Wine\nDreamberry wine was also invented by the Sarvaran minikin, and was their preferred alcoholic drink of choice. Dreamberries got their name from the dreamy effect that drunkenness on the wine would provide the Sarvarans.\n### Use\nDreamberry bushes are used by some Minikin cultures to defend bases and stockpiles. They are planted in hedges at the base of trees, walls, and burrows, warding off opportunists who may want to eat stored food or attack those beyond the bushes.\n## Sparkberry Bush\nSparkberry bushes are a plant native to the 2nd realm. They have vibrant green leaves, and small blue berries.\n### Sparkberries\nSparkberries are small, round, blue, and slightly phosphorescent. They are naturally consumed by electric [dragons](fauna/dragons.md) in the wild, who fly elsewhere and disperse seeds through their dung.\n\nThey are inedible when raw, and send out painful shocks when touched by most animals, including Minikin. They can however be harvested using telekinesis through Alucinara energy, and are edible once cooked.\n## Elkfruit Trees\n\n### Elkfruit\n\n### Elkfruit Wine\n\n## Darkwort\n\n### Darkwort Vines\n\n### Darkwort Leaves\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["flora","second-realm"]},"/history/early-minikin-history":{"title":"Early History of the Minikin","content":"![](images/qherelh-world-map.png)\n## Timeline\n### 5 MYA\n- Minikin begin to diverge from the lineage that would become red squirrels\n- Minikin ancestors are shifted from the 0th realm to the 2nd due to supernova\n### 3 MYA\n - The genus Anthrosciurus diverges from Sciurus\n - Anthrosciurids begin to use tools\n### 1 MYA\n- Anthrosciurids begin to use fire and [magic](cosmology/alucinara.md)\n- Language is developed in Anthrosciurids\n### 300,000 YA\n- Early Minikin evolve into Modern Minikin (Anthrosciurus arborensis) in northern [Tséireph](lore/tseireph.md)\n### 200,00 YA\n- First wave of minikin migration takes place\n- Ancestors of Eastern Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis occidentalis) migrate to the eastern continent and eastern islands\n- Modern Minikin spread across whole of Tséireph\n### 175,000 YA\n - Second wave of minikin migration takes place\n - Ancestors of Southern Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis australis) migrate to southwestern continent\n### 50,000 YA\n - Third and final wave of minikin migration takes place\n - Ancestors of Insular Minikin (subspecies Anthrosciurus arborensis insulensis) diverge from Southern Minikin and continue to migrate south to the southwestern archipelago\n - The various Minikin subspecies begin to spread and cohabitate with other races\n### 10,000 YA\n- Agriculture begins to be practised by Minikin, originating in fluvial areas with seasonal floods, especially the mediterranean-climate Sarvaran river basin.\n## Further Reading\n- [Sarvaran history](history/morellic-history.md)","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.383918666Z","tags":["minikin","lore"]},"/history/morellic-history":{"title":"History of the Morellic Minikin","content":"## Overview\nThe Morellic race is a race of minikin descending from the Sarvaran, Aqhoran, and Corothic cultures.

It was polysynthetic, head-final, and head-marking, with an SOV word order.\n### Chronology\nSarvaran descended from Proto-Morellic, which was spoken by the Early Morellic nomads in the southern half of Tseireph during the Early Morellic Period.\n\nThrough Old Sarvaran and Middle Sarvaran, it developed into its Classical form, which was spoken during the Sarvaran Golden Age. It was during this time that the majority of the language's poetic works, songs, and prose were composed.\n\nEventually, it developed into Vulgar Sarvaran, its more colloquial register. And after the Sarvaran Collapse, it developed during the Morellic Dark Ages into Stonechild Imperial. This language was spoken in the Empire of the Petrified Child, while Classical Sarvaran was kept as a liturgical, artistic language, by the time of the Morellic Renaissance Period.\n#### See Also:\n- [Proto-Morellic]\n- [Stonechild Imperial]\n- [Modern Morellic]\n## Examples\n\n## Phonology\n\n### Consonants\n| **Consonants** |                 | **Labial** | **Labiodental** | **Dental** | **Coronal** | **Palatal** | **Velar**  | **Uvular** |\n| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| **Nasals**     | **Plain**       | m          |                 |            | n           | ɲ \\\u003cny\u003e     | ŋ \\\u003cng\u003e    |            |\n| **Plosives**   | **Plain**       | p          |                 | t̪ \\\u003ct\u003e    |             | t͡ʃ \\\u003ctc\u003e   | \\[k] \\\u003ck\u003e  | q          |\n|                | **Voiced**      | b          |                 | d̪ \\\u003cd\u003e    |             | d͡ʒ \\\u003cdj\u003e   | g          |            |\n| **Fricatives** | **Plain**       | \\[ɸ] \\\u003cph\u003e | f               | \\[θ] \\\u003cth\u003e | s           | ʃ \\\u003cc\u003e      |            | χ \\\u003cqh\u003e    |\n|                | **Voiced**      | \\[β] \\\u003cbh\u003e | v               | ð \\\u003cdh\u003e    |             | ʒ \\\u003cj\u003e      | \\[ɣ] \\\u003cgh\u003e |            |\n| **Sonorants**  | **Plain**       | w          |                 |            | r           | j \\\u003cy\u003e      |            |            |\n|                | **Devoiced**    |            |                 |            | \\[r̥] \\\u003crh\u003e |             |            |            |\n| **Laterals**   | **Approximant** |            |                 |            | l           | ʎ \\\u003cll\u003e     |            |            |\n|                | **Fricative**   |            |                 |            | \\[ɬ] \\\u003clh\u003e  |             |            |            |\nThere are many allophonic rules in Sarvaran, owing to the language's historical forms and sound changes.

Sarvaran also lacks the definite article.\n### Pronouns\nIn sarvaran, pronouns almost never appear alone, they are always accompanied by a head, to which they depend or modify. They are attached onto adpositions, verbs, and possessed nouns.\n\n| **Pronouns**  | **Singular** | **Plural** | **No Number** |\n| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |\n| `1`           | san- / są-  | ey(a)-     |               |\n| `2`           | n(i)-        | ul-        |               |\n| `3` / `3.OTH` |              |            | m(u)-         |\n| `3.ANML`      |              |            | ell(a)-       |\n| `3.PLNT`      |              |            | yon- / yǫ-   |\n| `3.DEI`       |              |            | l(i)-         |\nPronouns feature 4 gender-like versions of the 3rd person pronoun, which lack number, unlike the 1st and 2nd person pronouns. The pronoun `3` (3rd person other) is mostly used for people and abstract concepts, but refers to anything within the 3rd person. The pronoun `3.ANML` refers to animals and animate natural processes, such as rivers or weather. The pronoun `3.PLNT` refers to plants and inanimate objects, such as buildings or geological formations. The pronoun `3.DEI` refers to deities and celestial beings, such as watchstones, the Angels, and the Judges.\n### Possession\nPossessive phrases in Sarvaran are achieved by attaching the pronominal prefix of the possessor onto the possessed noun and optionally including the possessor noun before the possessed.\n\nHeads do not include the pronominal agreement affix in the 3rd person singular other form. Only including it in situations where there is either no nominal subject, or to classify the dependent as referring to a concept previously mentioned. For example:\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e san-isyar-uqella-qa\n\u003e `1-companion-animal-PAU`\n\u003e 'Some of my pets'\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e n-aluq-ith widrilh qelh mu-san-olwanay-u.\n\u003e `2-dream-PL terrify_STV and 3-1-upset-PST`\n\u003e 'Your dreams are terrifying and they scare me.'\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e abiyǫ yon-owir-ith\n\u003e `tree 3.PLNT-leaf-PL`\n\u003e 'A tree's leaves'\n### Adpositions\nSimilarly to genitive phrases, adpositional phases also feature the adposition succeeding the noun they modify, and agreeing with the noun's gender with a pronominal prefix.\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e dwarq-ith yǫ-sï\n\u003e `branch-PL 3.PLNT-on`\n\u003e 'On the branches'\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e ni-qelh\n\u003e `2-with`\n\u003e 'With you'\n### Verbs\nVerbs are the most morphologically dense aspect of Sarvaran, featuring polypersonal agreement, noun incorporation, many tenses, aspects, and moods, and the inclusion of adverbial morphemes.\n\n| Subject Pronoun | Direct Object Pronoun / Incorporated Noun Stem | Indirect Object Pronoun | Negative Particle | Adverb Stem | Verb Stem | Tense | Aspect | Mood |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e san-owir-offurü\n\u003e `1.SG-leaf-read`\n\u003e 'I am reading a book.'\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e ul-sarqïtwarą-yürą-wa qassudh eya-mu-feyų-wa-s sï\n\u003e `2.PL-Sarqitwara-eat-PST day 1.PL-3-meet-PST-PFV on`\n\u003e 'You all were eating Sarqitwaras on the day we met.'\n\n\u003e [!quote] Example\n\u003e mu-per-sawag-mos áuqï m-iyaqhru-mos-eyę\n\u003e `3-NEG-survive-FUT.PRES if 3-fall-FUT.PRES-COND`\n\u003e 'They aren't going to survive if they fall.'","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.399918944Z","tags":["language","sarvaran"]},"/lore/2nd-realm":{"title":"The 2nd Realm","content":"## Overview\nThe 2nd realm is the 2nd ultra-essent realm, and is contra-essent to the -2nd realm.

They were united by a common culture and ethnicity, but saw themselves as very disparate.\n\nThe early Morellic tribes served as the predecessors of [Sarvara](lore/sarvara.md) and [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md), and spoke a continuum of Proto-Morellic dialects, including Old Sarvaran and Old Corothic.\n\nThey were contemporary with the pre-aqhoran tribes, but would not make contact with them until they migrated to the southern coast of Tseireph and founded the city-state of Aqhor at the dawn of the minikin Bronze age.\n## Clothing Practices\nThe early Morellic tribes wore clothes made of animal hide, fur, leather, woven grass leaves, and plant fibre, such as from Lunuth. They would commonly wear long dress-like tunics, cloaks, belts with pouches, sandals, and jewellery made of bones, shells, volcanic glass, and stones[^2].\n\nThey would not wear more sophisticated fabrics until the bronze age saw great developments in agriculture, namely the domestication of Lunuth wheat and invention of Lunuth fabric. They would sew their hide and leaves together using bone needles and plant fibre, and would commonly dye their clothing colours such as red or orange.\n## Religion\nThe early Morellic religion was decentralised, [angel](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md)-worshipping, and polytheistic. The early Morellic Minikin would make prayers, sacrifice, and worship to these deities, whom they could communicate with in dreams. Each tribe, clan, family would have patron deities who were believed to have a level of influence over the good fortune of their worshippers.\n\nThe chief deity of the early Morellic religion was the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), who protected nature, all things holy, and the innocent. It was believed that the petrified child was the firstborn of the god of nature, known as '*Kherelli*[^1],' and that the other deities were her other children.\n## Calendar\nThe early morellic tribes used variations of a lunisolar calendar called the '*kasuumitvirsu*[^8].' Years were made up of 297 days with 8 day weeks, divided 8 months of 36 days (with an extra intercalary month every 4 years), and began around the start of summer. The early morellic tribes counted a person's age from the month they were born, rather than the day.\n### Days of the Week\n\n| **Name**    | Itrunkasu       | Keerakasu      | Takharkasu      | Apihonkasu    | Medhankasu      | Uyulikasu       | Uukamikasu      | Alukkasu        |\n| ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| **Meaning** | Day of Foraging | Day of Hunting | Day of the Moon | Day of Plants | Day of Building | Day of the Gods | Day of Sleeping | Day of Dreaming |\n### Months of the Year\n| **Name**    | Aadrikhantakh    | Akharutakh    | Weerantakh     | Udrartakh    | Khereltakh       | Esirtakh          | Deshuutakh    | Itruntakh         | Takhar Sahuril                                   |\n| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Meaning** | Month of the Sun | Month of Fire | Month of Water | Month of Ice | Month of Qherelh | Month of the Wind | Month of Rain | Month of Foraging | Last Month (Intercalary, repeates every 4 years) |\n## Cultural Practices\n### Women\nWomen were respected and seen as greatly sacred in Morellic culture. In early Morellic society, it was customary for women to perform ablutions (involving cleansing of the body with water and the shaving of the head and tail) twice every day, symbolising their purity. In addition, women were further respected as spiritual leaders, mothers, and grandmothers.\n\nWomen commonly held high-ranking positions with a high amount of influence, symbolically acting as mothers over their clans, but were also permitted to perform other tasks such as foraging, pottery, and weaving.\n#### Matriarchs\nEarly morellic tribes were made up of clans led by Matriarchs, which tended to be grandmothers, wise beyond their years, ex-spiritual leaders, with great knowledge of sorcery. The matriarchs' authority was mutually agreed upon by the members of each clan, and they were cared for by the spiritual leaders of the group.\n\nFurthermore, their lifespans were prolonged through the use of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md), as the spiritual leaders would feed them aluciferous foods. This led to some matriarchs reaching above 40 years in age upon their deaths, which was rare in minikin, whose lifespan usually reached no more than 25.\n### Men\nMen were less respected than women, but were not oppressed. Men commonly held laborious positions, being hunters, foragers, and potters, but also had the opportunity to become spiritual leaders, elevating their rank in early Morellic society.\n\nSome wise and strong men would leave their clans, searching to find a wife from others in order to increase genetic diversity. Upon finding another group, they would undergo an initiation ritual to join the clan.\n#### Initiation Rituals\nInitiation Rituals, each known as an '*Adhiimnelya*[^7],' were led by the matriarch of the group in order to potentially let in an outsider for marriage. These outsiders would be required to prove themselves, showing endurance of pain, and would ultimately end in either ostracism or marriage to the most compatible bachelorette.\n\nThe tests of endurance included climbing up and down burning dead trees, and being attacked by various stinging insects. The matriarch of the inviting clan would watch, and ultimately decide wether the man seemed fit to enter.\n### Spiritual Leaders\nSpiritual leaders in the early morellic tribes were highly respected shamans, who would counsel, guide, and protect the members of the group. They were the only class permitted to make sacrifices, but they often made them on behalf of others.\n\nIn addition, early Morellic spiritual leaders also sang in choirs and played primitive flutes. Not only would they recite oral tradition in spoken form, but also in song; it was during the early Morellic period that shamanistic polyphonic singing was innovated, an art form expanded upon in later Morellic societies.\n\nFurthermore, the spiritual leaders were skilled not only in advisorship and music, but also sorcery and warfare. They often fought in early, small-scale battles. In Sarvara, they would evolve and split into two castes, that of warriors and priests.\n### Eunuchs\nEunuchs were rare in early morellic society, and were often ostracised from clans. However, this changed in future morellic societies; for example, in Sarvara, Eunuchs were accepted, but treated as adults from the beginning of their life, without the opportunity to live as a child, and mostly served as high-ranking advisors.\n### Sexuality\nSexuality in early morellic culture was not very restrictive. It was seen as normal for men and women to marry, and women commonly held many husbands. It was taboo, however, for men to be polygamous, but they were permitted to have romantic relationships with anybody within the group, regardless of gender.\n\nIt was also taboo for a minikin to be in a marriage or relationship with their immediate cousins, siblings, parent, parents' immediate cousins and siblings, and niblings. However, it was perfectly acceptable to romantically and sexually mingle outside of this group.\n\nFurthermore, the difference between friendship and relationship was blurred in early Morellic society; some friendships were purely platonic, but some included romantic aspects, without being fully-fledged relationships.\n### Marriage\nSpiritual leaders facilitated marriage ceremonies, which were permitted only between women and their husbands. Marriage ceremonies required the participants to wear special clothing, known as '*Byelodjunu*[^6],' and for the bride to recite oral tradition on the nature of marriage.\n\nThe ceremony was completed through covering one of each of the participants' palms with resin, and interlocking that hand with the other (the hands facing the spiritual leader). This symbolises the connection of those married.\n### Coming of Age\nThe early morellic coming of age ritual took place for males on their 6th birthday, and females' 5th, being the ages when the minikin reached the age of maturity and began to be held accountable for their actions. Eunuchs did not perform these rituals.\n#### In Males\nIn males, the coming of age ritual (known as the '*Areyomittakhar*[^3]') was a month-long pilgrimage into the wilderness, where the boy would have to learn to fight, hunt, and survive, symbolising his transition from dependent to independent.\n\nIf the boy survived, the month would end with their reintroduction to their group, with a celebration (known as 'Kulyaannelya[^4]') on the first day of the next month. A boy's *Kulyaanelya* involved the performance of music, a large feast for the whole group, and the boy's consumption of hallucinogenic [Nyuta tea](flora/nyutaberry.md), when he was to commune with the deities and make requests for the future and his life plans.\n#### In Females\nA females's *Areyomittakhar* was a more sophisticated process, where the girl's mothers and aunts would perform ablutions on her twice a day for a month. This symbolised a girls transition into womanhood and prepared the girl for the rituals that came with being an adult woman, which was a sacred position in morellic societies.\n\nOn the first day of the following month was the '\\*Osinnelya[^5],' which was a more private event than a *Kulyaanelya*. The *Sinakasudh* required the girl to recite the oral tradition pertaining to the sanctity of womanhood in front of an audience, after which she would retire home to consume Nyuta tea and perform the same requests as boys on their *Kulyaanelya*.\n\n[^1]: Old Sarvaran \u003c\u003c Proto-Morellic '\\*Kherelh-lhi,' meaning 'god of earth;' Cf.

The Sarvaran city and civilisation were located within the Sarvaran river basin, of southern [Tseireph](lore/tseireph.md), of the [2nd Realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).\n\nSarvara was founded during the Minikin Neolithic era, reaching its height during the Bronze Age, and was one of the first great cities, alongside [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md) and [Aqhor](groups-and-places/aqhor.md). It held a great amount of influence over the river basin, and served as the foundation for its successor state, the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/the-empire-of-the-petrified-child.md).\n## Etymology\nThe name for the city, '*Sarvárą*,' is made up of two roots, '*Sarav*,' the name of a river, and '*Rą*,' meaning 'City \\[of].' The name of the river Sarav was loaned into Old Sarvaran from Old Diiran, a native non-Morellic language.\n## Location\nSarvara was built on the Sarav river in the Sarvaran river basin, which was in southern Tseireph, a continent of Qherelh in the 2nd Realm. It had a mediterranean climate, with seasonal floods from the river. Aqhor was to the south, and Coroth to the northeast.\n\n![](images/sarvaran-river-basin.png)\n*The Sarvaran River Basin, with the locations of Sarvara, Aqhor, and Coroth.*\n## History\nSarvara was founded and built up by the [Early Morellic tribes](lore/early-morellic-tribes.md), who migrated into the basin from the east and settled down.\n\nSome notable historical figures include:\n- Babymeadow the Old, the city's first ruling high-matriarch\n- The Elephant, an early warrior who won a great battle\n- Snowleaf, an early cartographer and innovator of the Sarvaran logography.\n## Caste System\nThe sarvaran caste system was divided into 5 hereditary castes, derived from the early Morellic cultural structure, which then became reinforced by taboos and the organisation that came with the advent of the Bronze Age.\n### High-Matriarchs\nThe highest role in Sarvaran society was that of high-matriarchs, queen-like figures who ruled states. However, despite transcending the caste heirarchy, high matriarchs were not a caste in and of themselves, and were counted among the nobles.\n### Priests\nThe highest caste was the priests, who could be of any gender. This caste was derived from the spiritual leaders of the early Morellic tribes, and the duties of the priests were of celibacy, worship, and sacrifice. They led sermons in the temples.\n### Nobles\nThe second highest caste was the nobles; this caste was earned through honor and age; almost all matriarchs and their husbands were nobles. The nobles often owned land and employed vassals, mostly other nobles and commoners, to live and work there.\n### Warriors\nThe third highest were the warriors. They descended from the early spiritual leaders as well as the priests, but rather focussed more on protection and sorcery rather than pastoral care and worship. They were often seen as dispensible and replaceable, and systemically mistreated, leading to their place in the heirarchy.\n### Commoners\nThe second lowest caste was the commoners. They were the laypeople and workers, vassals of the nobles, and made up the majority of the population in Sarvaran society. They were farmers, builders, smiths, and artists.\n### Wretched\nThe lowest caste was the wretched. These were the least in Sarvaran society, those with diseases such as leprosy, those who were dishonoured, and those who had commited social crimes such as treason. The wretched often lived outside of city walls, within primitive and basal communities.\n## Calendar\nThe date of the city's founding serves as year 0 of the Sarvaran calendar, which was one of the many innovations made by the Sarvaran Minikin. Other notable innovations included pottery, poetry, art, early mass-production, war, and cartography.\n## See Also:\n- [Sarvaran Architecture](lore/sarvaran-architecture.md)\n- [Early Morellic Tribes](lore/early-morellic-tribes.md)","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.403919013Z","tags":["sarvara","morellic","locations"]},"/lore/sarvaran-architecture":{"title":"Sarvaran Architecture","content":"## Overview\nThe architecture of [Sarvara](lore/sarvara.md) refers to the many styles and methods of building structures within the city state, and further settlements and outposts within its cultural sphere.\n\nIt was defined by intricate dwellings built in the trees or on the ground, with the main materials being [Dhajarh](flora/dhajar-trees.md) wood, bricks of stone taken from the mountains with bitumen used as mortar, fluvial clay, and Lunuth fabric.\n\nClassical Sarvaran architecture is found in the high-class structures of the Sarvaran golden age, and lived on in the neoclassical architecture of the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md) and the Corothic Republic.\n## Characteristics\n### Temples\nTemples were grand constructions in Sarvara, serving as the centrepieces of their respective districts and settlements. They were constructed out of many materials, including stone and wood, and were built on (sometimes artificial) mounds of earth.\n\nThe temples were circular or octagonal[^1] in shape, with one entrance leading in and out. The perimeter of the temples featured a hallway passing around the structure, which was accented by arched columns, and a plurality of watchstones carved into the walls.\n#### Main Area\nThe main area of the temples was paved with stone, with a raised platform in the centre; this is the altar where sacrifices would be performed by priests, rituals would be performed, and sermons would be given to the audience. The audience would collect in the surrounding area, kneeling or prostrating in reverence of the deities.\n#### Ablution Areas\nThe temples would also feature areas for ablution, where women could ddraw water from the ground with pumps built into the walls. This is where women would gather in the morning and evening to perform their ritual cleaning.\n#### Open and Closed Temples\nThe main areas of the temples were either open or enclosed. Temples were tiered, with the perimetric hall sloping up toward another wall, with clerestory windows. Open temples would conclude their walls here; however, enclosed temples would have their walls continue into another sloped roof.\n#### Rooves\nSome temples were semi-enclosed, with their rooves replaced by dome-shaped windows, allowing intricate designs to be cast on the ground by the sun. Another form of semi-enclosed temple had smaller, concentric windows in the roof.\n### Monasteries and Barracks\nMonasteries and barracks were synonymous within Sarvaran culture, with both warriors and priests descending from the same early Morellic caste, the spiritual leaders.\n\nThese structures were similar to temples, only without a central area, and would feature kitchens and dormitories. The monasteries also featured many watchstones and small altar rooms, and the barracks would feature closed-eye watchstones, armories, and a large bronze gate through which the soldiers would march out.\n### Plazas and Markets\nSarvaran plazas often made their place in the centres of settlements or their districts. They were also found more frequently on tree platforms, and often featured benches and sitting areas as well as a large area to stand and walk; they also featured garden plots to augment the urban environment with foliage.\n\nThese plazas would serve as communal locations for trade, socialisation, protest, and for heralds to bring news to the people. Around and within these plazas could be found market stands, where goods could be traded for gold.\n\nThese market stands were commonly constructed out of wood, with a table, drawer to contain gold, and tiled rooves. They were often basal structures, but some were quite sophisticated, and some settlements even constructed stone market stands to incentivise trade.\n### Roads and Foundations\nSarvaran Minikin built roads and foundations out of gravel, sand, clay, and stone slabs. Roads featured gutters, through which water would be channeled, and enter irrigation channels, the ground, wells, catacombs, or sewers.\n#### Arboreal Pathways\nArboreal pathways were constructed out of clay, which was packed down onto the upside of large treebranches. These would be smoothed over, and had stairs carved into steep areas. These pathways would feature short railings made of carved stone, which would guide the minikin to stay on path; however, they could always realign themselves wth [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md).\n### Windows\nSarvaran buildings would feature unglazed windows with wooden grilles in place of glass; these grilles would be constructed out of Dhajarh wood, and carved into arabesque, intricate, patterns. Often, buildings would be aligned with the sun as to cast patterned shadows through the windows across the floor.\n### Rooves\nThe rooves of some Sarvaran buildings were sloped and made up of three layers; Lunuth straw, Lunuth fabric, and fluvial clay baked into tiles. The fabric and straw worked as insulation, and tiles allowed rainwater to flow down and over the structure.\n\nFurthermore, the corners of the rooves were notched, serving as gutters to channel water. This water would flow through gargoyles when it reached the rim of the roof, and watchstones would commonly be carved into them.\n\nDue to this, it was uncommon for gargoyles to be carved with their eyes closed, and this was only found around places of systemic inequality where those in power wished to be exempt from the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md)'s law.\n### Wooden Mansions\nWooden mansions, mainly built as treehouses, are a striking characteristic of Sarvaran architecture. They were commonly built around and tree trunks, specifically of Dhajarh trees, but could also be constructed on the ground.\n\nThey followed a polygonal, circular shape, and were constructed out of wood, with unglazed, patterned windows. Houses built on the ground often featured a surrounding pavement that led into the roads of the settlement.\n#### Treehouses\nTreehouses were wooden mansions built on the trunks of Dhajarh trees, within or just beneath the canopy. They were supported by large wooden supports jammed into the trunks, and set atop the foundation of wooden planks above these supports.\n\nThey would feature a trapdoor or hole by the trunk of the structure, sometimes with rope ladders dangling down, allowing Minikin to fly into the mansions from underneath.\n##### Tree Platforms\nAs treehouses were set atop foundations and supports, these platforms often appeared without buildings on top of them. These platforms were used for a variety of purposes, such as communal plazas, lookout spots, and markets.\n### Storage Shelters\nThe Sarvaran Minikin would also build storage shelters out of clay on treebranches. These shelters would commonly contain goods, such as Lunuth grain, fruit, berries, or materials like bronze, gold, diamonds, and alucium.\n\nThey took the form of round compartments which dangled from the canopy, but could vary from high to low quality. They were sometimes given hinged wooden doors or fabric curtains.\n\nHigher-caste storage shelters were often carved with ornate patterns, similar to the aforesaid window grilles. They were also fitted with tiered, round bottoms, which tapered off into points, from which would be attached a small ornament or a banner which flew in the wind.\n### Huts\nSome structures were huts, which took on many forms. They were generally inhabited by the lower-caste individuals, and were less sophisticated than treehouses or temples. These huts could be built on the ground or in the trees, and were used as living areas, where the inhabitants would live, eat, and sleep.\n#### Kitchens\nWithin or outside these huts would often be built kitchen areas, with surfaces to prepare food, pantries or cabinets to store it, and stoves where fire could be kindled and channelled out of the top through an opening.\n##### Stoves\nThese stoves were small, partially-enclosed spaces, where fire would heat sheets of slate or pots placed above the opening, where food could then be cooked or boiled.\n#### Treehuts\nAn example is that of treehuts, which were built on ground-level within hollowed-out treetrunks. These huts would be fitted with primitive wooden doors and unsophisticated windows carved into the walls.\n\nThey would sometimes be partially sub-terranean, dug further into the ground to maximise space. In these cases, the floor may be slightly underground, or basements might be built-in with a wooden floor implemented at ground level.\n#### Mushroom Huts\nYet another example is mushroom huts. These were made of [Giant Morels](flora/giant-morels.md), a large, domesticated species of Morel that would grow, dry out into robust frames, and hollowed out into dwellings.\n\nThese huts would feature up to 3 storeys, with holes cut into the centre of each level, and a rope dangling through the centre to be climbed. They would similarly be fitted with primitive doors, with window-holes cut out of the mushroom's cap and filled in with circular window grilles.\n### Clay Huts\nSome huts were built out of clay, like storage shelters. They were either built on the ground, or as storage shelters, in the canopy. On the ground, they were round, wide, and conical, their walls tapering off into points to allow rainwater to flow off.\n\nIn the canopy, they were sometimes indistinguishable to storage shelters. However, they were often larger, padded with straw, wool, and were only used as places in which to sleep.\n### Toilets and Baths\nToilets and Baths were also an important building in Sarvaran culture. Most minikin would wash themselves and expel waste in nearby rivers, but the higher-caste individuals would do so in specially constructed buildings.\n\nThese buildings were similar to wooden mansions, only with stone pools in which to wash one's self, stations where towels and clothes were kept on shelves, and toilets that led into subterranean sewers.\n### Sewers\nThese sewers would connect the gutters, baths, and toilets within a settlement into an underground system of canals that would divert the flow of rivers to flush waste into the ground or back into river systems. They were built out of stone, as wood would rot.\n\n[^1]: 8 was a holy number to the Sarvaran minikin. Minikin have 8 fingers, and the Sarvaran language followed a base-8 system.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.403919013Z","tags":["lore","sarvara"]},"/lore/tseireph":{"title":"Tseireph","content":"## Overview\nTseireph is a continent of the planet Qherelh in the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).

They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of Alucinara, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.\n\nThey can pose a violent threat, as their crystalline claws or teeth can cause lacerations, infection, and a risk of phantasmarrhoea if a shard of alucium were to break off in the wound.\n\n![Cloud Gnat](images/cloud-gnat.png)\n\n## Appearance\nCloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty and purple, with an average length of 22cm. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [alucium](cosmology/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain Alucinara and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.403919013Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna"]},"/phenomena/phantasmarrhoea":{"title":"Phantasmarrhoea","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nPhantasmarrhoea is an illness characterised by the appearance of [alucium](cosmology/alucinara.md) crystals on the skin, essential shift, violent behaviour, hallucinations, and delusions.","lastmodified":"2024-08-22T13:11:30.403919013Z","tags":["illnesses","phenomena","alucinara"]},"/phenomena/soulstone":{"title":"Soulstones","content":"## Overview\nSoulstones are deposits of bitumen or asphalt where, in the presence of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) energy, the soul of a deceased organism may be stored after death.\n## Appearance\nThe appearance of a Soulstone is that of a pebble or rock with a matte, rough, or shiny black surface. Over time, the surface of the stone may warp to reflect the visage or form of the soul inside.\n## Behaviour\nSoulstones contain the deceased's soul by tricking the [Darkness](deities/the-darkness.md) into believing that the stone is a viable body. This is accomplished through the emulation of organic compounds, due to the presence of Hydrocarbons.\n## Uses\nWithout a soulstone, the soul of a deceased organism will flee to the Pond.\n### To Store the Dead\nSoulstones are used to circumvent this, as they provide a sentimental object to project the life of a relative or loved one onto.

And the second Judge was subordinate to the First, and was not able to decree the laws of nature, for it was a counsellor to the First.\n\nBut the cosmos was destitute, and shapeless. And so the second Judge said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given shape.' Hearing this, the First decreed that the cosmos must be given shape, and from the void emerged dust and water, all of the material of the cosmos.\n\nBut the Judges could not see their creation, and thus the second Judge said, 'we must create a light, so that we may see our creation.' Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that a light may be created, and from the void emerged flames bright enough that they should see their entire creation. And the Judges named this light, 'Sun.'\n\nBut all things were at rest, and without order. And so the second Judge  said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given order.' But the First said, 'this is not a task for us, but for another rank.' And so the First created the [Angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) to govern the materials of the cosmos, according to the laws of nature. And the Judges contained the laws within an immanent energy throughout all of the cosmos, and named this energy, '[Alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md),' for they had invisioned it.\n\nAnd the Angels had license to decree all things within their dominion, and the Angels looked upon the cosmos, decreeing, 'it is good that the dust and water should collect in lands and seas, and that the lands should collect in planets by the sun, and that the seas should collect in oceans on the planets.' And so the lands collected in planets, and moons, and asteroids, and the seas collected in oceans, which were upon the lands.\n### The Second Judge's Covetousness and the Spirits of Darkness Created\nNow the second Judge was covetous of the first Judge's authority, saying, 'why should my superior and my subordinates decree all things, and I not, but rather to counsel them? Is not the beauty that has been created my own, for I advised its creation?' And so the second Judge hid from the First in secret, and decreed new laws of nature. And the Second contained these laws within an energy incarnate in spirits[^1], and named this energy, 'Darkness,' for it was hidden from the First and the Angels.\n\nAnd the [spirits of Darkness](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) asked the second Judge, 'O glorious, may you please fill us, that we may not be dishonourably hungry, and that our hunger may not dishonour you?' And so the second Judge gave the spirits dust to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, do you mean to dishonour us further? Fill us with something that should match your glory, that we may be a testament to it.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a moon to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, you dishonour yourself if you are to suppose that this matches your glory! Fill us with something greater.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a planet to eat, but the spirits were not filled.\n\nNow the spirits of Darkness did not fear judgement, as they were hidden. Distrusting their creator, they saw it well to consume other things, and thus began to eat other moons, other planets, and to drink seas, till there was nothing left but the Sun, and the Judges, and the Angels. Now the first Judge was horrified by the devestation that had been unleashed by the spirits, saying to its companion, 'why have you created these spirits? Do you not know it dishonours you to destroy the cosmos we gave shape to? I will surely have to destroy these spirits, lest they destroy the cosmos at last.' But the spirits, hearing that they should be destroyed, set themselves against the first Judge, to consume it.\n### the First Judge Destroyed and the Cosmos Shattered\nBut the first Judge and the Angels battled the spirits of Darkness, decreeing that each spirit should be returned to the cosmos as energy and matter. Now the advantage of the spirits was too great, and the Judge could not see them well. And it came to pass that the spirits defeated the Judge, and consumed it. But the power of the first Judge was too great, even in death, and the cosmos and everything within it was [shattered](cosmology/shattering.md), and scattered across many [realms](cosmology/realms.md).\n\nAnd so the surviving spirits of Darkness asked, 'O glorious, are we not now a testament to your glory?' But the Judge was ashamed of the consequences of its actions, and its heart was set against the spirits, saying, 'surely, you will not defeat me as you have consumed my companion.' And the spirits said, 'yes, for you are glorious.' But the Judge wept, saying, 'my companion was right, you were never to be the one testament to my glory, but rather this cosmos of our design. I see now that you lack glory, and your existence will forever shine unfavourably upon me.' And the spirits were afraid, saying, 'do you intend to destroy us?' And the Judge said, 'nay, for I cannot destroy, but I will create a punishment worthy of your iniquity.'\n## Chapter 2\n### New Laws of Nature Decreed and Spirits Given Form\nNow [the Judge](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md) resided within the [heavens](cosmology/heavens), which were above and inbetween the [shattered realms](cosmology/realms). And thus it decreed new laws of nature, that the remnants of the cosmos may be protected from further destruction. And the Judge contained the new laws within an energy to replace the energy of Alucinara, and the Judge named this new energy, '[justification](cosmology/justification.md),' for the spirits of Darkness were justified and punished for their iniquity.\n\nAnd so the Judge took the energy of [Alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md), and contained it within crystals, saying, 'the beauty of the old laws of the Angels shall appear from within beautiful crystals.' Also the Judge took the energy of [Darkness](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md), and contained the spirits within bodies of pitch, saying, 'it is befitting that you should be like filth, collecting in the dark places of the earths, for you are deserving of punishment.'\n\nBut the spirits of darkness were unhappy with their bodies, saying, 'we must escape the dark places of the earths.' And so they called out to the [Angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md), saying, 'are you not unhappy having authority over the dirt? Come, let us create new bodies for us, that you may have authority over something greater.' And so the Angels formed bodies of clay for the spirits, and the spirits of pitch resided within them, and escaped the dark places of the earths.\n### The Spirits Fired into Flesh, Stars, and Kinds\nNow the Judge was upset when it heard of this, saying, 'you have once again commited an act of iniquity against my decree.' But the spirits gloated, and said, 'are you not ashamed? for we have escaped the dark places of the earth, and created new bodies for ourselves greater than any thing you could create.' And the Judge was deeply wroth, saying, 'a false belief has sprouted within you, that you are greater than I, but I say that you inherit your greatness from me. I see that your new bodies are great, for they were created by the Angels, but the Angels are from me.' \n\nBut the spirits of Darkness would not listen, and so the Judge said, 'I decree that your bodies be fired into flesh, that you may toil to consume one another to survive, only to age and perish in the order of your years. And in death, you will burn within the heavens, as stars.' And so the Judge send a flame from the Suns upon the spirits, that they may be fired into flesh, as living beings. And the Judge said, 'I grant you one good thing, that you may bear heirs, and build families, that your legacy is not forgotten, and that the balance of life and death is even, and good.' And so the Judge sent a few spirits down upon the lands and seas, and the rest it kept within the heavens, to burn as stars, and they burn in constellation with one another to this day.\n\nAnd it came to pass that [the living beings](cosmology/living-beings.md) made homes for themselves upon the earths, but some planets were inhospitable. And the living beings were separated in kinds from one another by the Angels, into 'plants,' and 'animals.' And so the plants fed upon the light of suns and were humble, and the animals fed upon all other living beings and were not humble, and so the plants were given many years to live, but the animals were given less. And the Angels also appointed another kind, 'mould', to fulfil the laws of decay and perishing. And another kind, '[people](tags/people)', was set apart from the animals, to be a kind abounding with wisdom and faith.\n### The People Begin to Worship the Angels\nAnd the people were separated into many kinds among themselves. Some were separated from squirrels, called 'Minikin', and some from slugs, and some from apes. But the Judge looked upon the Minikin, and said, 'this kind is good, for they have the means to master the laws of Alucinara and Justification for righteous purposes.' And the Judge said to the Angels, 'come, let us will teach them of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, that they may be made wise in the fear of death and worship me.' And so the Judge and the Angels taught the Minikin of the ways of death, and magic, and fire, and they were wise in the fear of death. And the Minikin were settled in the 2nd realm, within the land of Deshwacath[^2], in the continent of Tseireph. And there the minikin built temples unto the Judge, and worshipped.\n\nBut it came to pass that the Minikin began to worship the Angels, for they could not discern the greatness of the Judge from the greatness of the Angels, for their minds were paltry compared to the celestial beings. And some Angels were evil, and merrymade in the misdirection of worship, and granted the petitions of the misfaithful in return for worship and sacrifice. And so the Judge's heart was deeply afflicted, and it was aggrieved by the false-worship of the angels, and cried out, 'O Angels! How many mistakes must I make before I learn–now I receive no praise, and no worship, for I have made yet another mistake. How it should have been me to die in place of you, O my superior companoon! For I am of lesser character than you, and the world would be exceeding great if I had not I destroyed you in my iniquity.'\n### The Judge Becomes the Petrified Child\nAnd the people heard this in an apparition, and were confused, saying, 'surely our creator has gone insane! It grieves for our faith, yet does not preserve us as the Angels do.' And so the Minikin priests went unto the Judge in the temples, asking, 'are you well?' But the Judge said, 'nay, for my heart is deeply afflicted, I have made another mistake, and the Angels are another testament to my iniquity, and I grieve for my companion, whom I destroyed in my iniquity.' And the Judge said also, 'You misplace your faith toward the mistakes of your creator, but I tell you that it it righteous that you should worship me alone.'\n\nAnd the priests said, 'O creator, how we did not know! Surely, you must atone for your iniquity, for you said to the mothers and fathers of our ancestors that pride is transgression, and yet you do not repent for your own sin.' And the Judge's heart was deeply moved, and the Judge cried out in the temples, 'it behoves me to redeem myself.' And so the Judge lifted its voice to all people in a hallucination, saying, 'I decree that I should be bound by the one duty now to protect the people whom I created an eld ago and punished for their iniquity.'\n\nAnd so the Judge birthed its spirit from itself into an offspring; a child, that it may be humble among people. And the child was to be made of stone, petrified by the Judge's memories of evil, and it was charged with the one duty to protect the people its parent had created. And so the Judge was no more, for its spirit now resided within the child it had become. And the minikin looked upon the child and named it, 'the Petrified Child.'\n### The People Create the Watchstones and Forget the Petrified Child\nNow [the Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md)'s vision was greatly limited, and could not see, and it was not able to protect the Minikin well. And the child came into the temples and said to the priests, 'may you please carve eyes into the rocks for me, that I may see, and protect you?' And so the people carved the eyes into stone, and named them 'watchstones.' The people built watchstones in cliff-faces, boulders, rocks, and pebbles, and kept them as charms within their pockets, that they may be protected from the evil of one another and the beastly kinds of the animals.\n\nBut some minikin were evil, and secretly remained in worship of the Angels, and hid the watchstones. And there were no watchstones in the temples, and in homes, and it was in these places that the people hurt one another, and worshiped false-gods, and were not righteous unto the child, and did not fear it. And so the minikin did not teach their daughters and sons of the child, and died, and their children lacked the inheritence of faith that protected them. And it came to pass as the generations passed that the watchstones were worn down to dust, and were no more.\n## Chapter 3\n### Asthara Chosen by the Angels\nNow in the land of [Tseireph](lore/tseireph.md) lived a Deshwarite priestess called Asthara, and her husband with her. And it came to pass that in the deep hours of the night, the sinless Angels sent a message in a dream to Asthara, saying, 'you shall have a daughter, and she will bring all of Deshwacath back to true faith. And you will call her name 'Yahna,' for she will be righteous amongst people.' And Asthara was deeply troubled by this, for she had not yet learned of true faith, and it was the custom that priests should not bear children.\n\nAnd so she knelt down in the temple, and brought her soul close to the Angels, asking, 'why have you charged me with motherhood? Do you not recognise my robes as those of a priestess?' and the angel Ceiris[^5], whom was the explainer, spoke out in an apparition, saying, 'Asthara, do not weep! For this is a great task you have been charged with. We see that your heart is good amongst people, and you have been chosen as the progenitor of the slayer of misfaith.' But Asthara was worried, saying, 'tell me you are lying, for I must not have devoted my life to misfaith.' and Ceiris said, 'yea, but it was not in vain. Your misfaith has laid the foundation for the new age of true faith.'\n### The Girl Rescued from the River Morassar\nAnd so Asthara left the temple, and was walking along the river Morassar[^6] to her home, when she saw a baby girl in the waters. And she was greatly surprised, and drew the girl out of the river, but the child was blue, and was not breathing, and so Asthara cast magic, pulling the water from her lungs, and the girl was revitalised. And Asthara asked, 'where are your parents, young girl? May the Angels rebuke whomever hurt you, O precious creation.' But the girl responded, 'I have no parents,' for she was an orphan. And she said, 'I was merely playing alone by the riverbank, and I fell in.' And so Asthara asked, 'do you have a home?' But the girl said, 'nay,' for she could not answer. And Asthara asked also, 'do you have a name?' but the girl could not answer also. And so Asthara took the girl's hand and walked the rest of the way home, and took the girl as her child, calling her 'Perrelim[^7],' for she did not know who she was.\n\nAnd it came to pass after many years that as Asthara laid down in her bed to sleep, Ceiris called out for her in a dream, saying, 'O good priestess! You believe that Perrelim is an ordinary girl, but you have seen that she is exceeding fair and good amongst the Deshwarites, and I tell you that she is in fact Yahna.' And Asthara awoke, and could not sleep, for she understood that the age of true faith was upon her, and she knelt down and said, 'I do not know if I can handle the responsibility.' And Ceiris responded from the heavens, 'be faithful and listen out for the truth from your daughter, and you will be preserved from fear in true understanding.'\n\n[^1]: Sarvaran '*qáyanith*,' meaning 'souls,' or 'pieces of tar,' (*qayą́* / *qayan-* + *-ith* `soul-PL`.)
