The culture began as the two tribes, Rhohita and Cervina, met.\n\n## Language\n[Proto-morellic](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/proto-morellic.md) was the language spoken by the proto-morellic culture.\n\n## Beliefs\n### Origin\nProto-morellic minikin correctly believed that they came from squirrels. In fact, they were created by the fertility god Lwubo.\n\nLwubo, the child of the Great Tree, was envious of her creator for creating humanity. She saw them create great structures and take advantage of their realm, and wanted to make her own \"humans.\"\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be feasible to create duplicates of the race, so she took her favourite animal of the 0th Realm, Squirrels, and with the help of the fire god, melted an array of squirrels into clay.\n\nShe would mould them to her satisfaction, giving them anthropoid body plans, but unlike humanity she gave them snouts, digitigrade feet, tails, and [fortuitary glands](fauna/biology/fortuitary-gland).\n\nOnce done, she enlisted the help of the fire god's brother, the ice god, to freeze her creatures, after which she scattered them across the landscape of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md).\n\n### The Tail\nAs the proto-morellic minikin believed they had come form squirrels, they saw their tails as a direct physical manifestation of their connection to their divine ancestors.\n\n#### Tail Removal\nDue to their deification of the body part, lack of them was a major taboo, and removal of the tail was reserved for criminal punishments or extreme counter-cultural body modification.\n\nThe lack of a tail was seen that a Minikin's body was desecrated. It was common to throw stones or other objects at tail-less others, as bruising and wounding an already desecrated body would bring luck to those whom still retained their tails.\n\n##### Weaponry\nIn fact, as the proto-morellic culture became more advanced, a specialised weapon was developed to cut off tails, similar to the guillotine in the 0th Realm.\n\nThe weapon was handheld, similar to a sickle, but was incredibly sharp - designed to take the extremity off in one swipe.\n\nBy the time of the Sarvaran civilisation, the weapon was mainly kept for religious and decorative purposes, displayed upon the trunk of one's Family Tree. This deterred intruders from stealing resources or other items out of fear.\n\n### The Petrified Child\nBefore 3,000 YA, the Petrified Child was a common factor in life. An incomprehensible beast attacking your crops? No problem - the petrified child will be there to destroy it.\n\n#### Origins\nThe Petrified Child was created when the gods realised they were never given the power to destroy. They couldn't make another which could, so they did the next best thing. Lwubo, the fertility god, birthed the petrified child - a baby frozen in rock with the power to turn all evil into sludge.\n\nHowever, the petrified child is still a child - this is why the new deity had to be immature. An adult could be compassionate and empathetic to a beast, but a baby would just want the beast to go away. It would do everything in its power to get rid of the beast.\n\n#### Design\nThe knowledge that the Morellic people had of the petrified child was that it was relatively large, with a smooth surface made of mossy rock, and the face of a hairless baby minikin inset into the top-heavy section of the deity's bean-shaped body.\n\nLater on, however, the design shifted over time. The need for the Petrified Child diminished as the people got better at defending themselves, and the deity became less and less seen to the point that its form shifted through time as the culture progressed.\n\n##### Sarvaran Civilisation\nThe people of the Sarvaran Peninsula began seeing the deity as an owl as, not only were the words for \"owl\" and \"child\" similar in Saarn Adheill, but also owls became more and more associated with the destruction of predators. For example, a strong owl could take and eat a weasel, stoat, or pine marten which would usually prey on Minikin.\n\nThe child's face became more owl-like, with two eyes and a beak, and began being depicted with feathers surrounding the ridge around the inset face. In addition, the depiction also gained wings to the side, and feet at the bottom.\n\n##### Dwirivan Archipelago Civilisation\nThe people of the Dwirivan Archipelago, however, began to see the petrified child not as a child or an owl but more as a moth\n\nThe body, rather than simply being a bean-shaped body, began being depicted as a silken cocoon.\n\nThe head shifted from the front of the upper section of the body to the top of the upper section, lost all facial features but two large compound eyes, and grew two large antennae to the top.\n\n##### Empire of the Petrified Child\nThe empire of the petrified child, however, experienced a boom in worship of the deity. Through the research and study of monks of older documents, it was rediscovered the older, true form of the deity - and the depictions shifted back. Every  outdated statue or idol of the child was destroyed.\n\nThe depiction of the petrified child in the empire mainly focused on the child's face, and less so the body. It was thoroughly researched how the child looked like, and the depictions of the child began featuring decorative ridges weaving across the baby's skin, as this was a feature sometimes drawn for the child in older documents.\n\n##### Fall of the Empire\nOnce the Empire fell, the petrified child's depictions drastically changed. The documents and idols describing the child were lost, but the fall of the empire heavily involved the child - every survivor must have seen it in plain view as it levelled the entire empire into a baby meadow.\n\nThe form of the petrified child altered as the children of the changed world began to associate the child's appearance with the idolised stories of the lost empire's machinery, infrastructure, and architecture made of gold, [alucinarium](alucinara/alucinarium.md), clay, porcelain, and colourful dye.\n\nThe rebuilding of society in the imperial baby meadow wasn't difficult, and it only took 500 years to essentially reach the same point of development which the Sarvaran civilisation reached, especially due to the help of unaffected cultures outside of the imperial meadow.\n\n##### Imperial Meadow Civilisation\nBy the time of the imperial meadow civilisation, the child's appearance had a surface of shattered shards of porcelain held together with an internal body of gold, a non-shattered smiling porcelain face, and lush plants growing from the cracks, influenced by the Imperial Meadow's lush forest that grew from the child's sludge.","lastmodified":"2022-11-14T16:55:35.008294776Z","tags":null},"/cultures/morellic/morelland/morelland":{"title":"Morelland","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-14T16:55:35.008294776Z","tags":null},"/cultures/morellic/petrified-child":{"title":"The Petrified Child","content":"## Appearance\nThe petrified child appears throughout the majority of history  as a floating bean-shape with a face inset into the top half.\n\n### Owl\nThe petrified child began being depicted with an owl's face around the beginning of the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md). \n\nThis was due to the fact that, not only were owls a significant predator against [minikin](fauna/2nd%20realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md) (further influencing the idea of the petrified child as a being whom brings death in the name of good), but also the word for \"child\" and \"owl\" evolved into the same form in the [Stonechild Imperial](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/stonechild-imperial/stonechild-imperial.md) language.\n\n### Cocoon\n\n## Fall of the Empire of the Petrified Child\n### Face Location\nAround the time that the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md) fell, the petrified child's face moved from the front of its body to the top.\n\nRetaining the owl-like face, the deity grew a more realistic appearance, influenced by the clay-workers of the Morellic culture who found it difficult to attach a face to the front.","lastmodified":"2022-11-14T16:55:35.008294776Z","tags":null},"/cultures/morellic/sarvara/sarvara":{"title":"Sarvara","content":"The Sarvaran Civilisation existed around 7,000YA, and spoke [Sarvaran](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md).\n\n## Notable People\n### Hastini the Elephant\nHastini the Elephant `Sarvaran: Hestį́da /xesˈtĩ́.da/` was a Sarvaran general who was known to wear a copper elephant mask over his mouth.

were divided into 3 classes or genders, with 3 noun cases, Nominative, Accusative, and Dative, and 2 numbers, Singular and Plural.\n\n#### Beneficial\nBeneficial gender was used for pronouns, body parts, edible foods, and healthy phenomena such as sunlight.\nBeneficial|Singular|Plural\n----------|--------|------\nNominative|`-i`      |`-jɛt`\nAccusative|`-äs`     |`-äsɛt`\nDative    |`-ur`     |`-urɛt`\n\n#### Benign\nBenign gender was used for non-threatening non-beneficial animals, phenomena which didn't effect health, and some foods.\nBenign|Singular|Plural\n----------|--------|------\nNominative|`-ɛç̠`     |`-ɛɣuc̠`\nAccusative|`-iɫ`     |`-iluc̠`\nDative    |`-ɛt`     |`-ɛtuc̠`\n\n#### Malign\nMalign gender was used for

 |`-idäm`\nDative    |`-ɔm`     |`-ɔmäm`\n\n### Verbs\nVerbs in Proto-Morellic were declined for whether the action was volitional or not.\n\nFor example, **Sneezing** would be non-volitional, and would take the `-ve` suffix unless it was done on purpose (somehow.)\n\nIn addition, Proto-Morellic also had 3 tenses, Non-past, Past, and Distant Past, which  was also used as a Gnomic tense in some cases.\n\nIt also had 4 aspects, Imperfect, Perfect, Progressive, and Prospective, for whether an action isn't completed, is completed, is progressing, and whether it is going to happen.\n\nVolitional    |Non-past|Past     |Distant Past\n--------------|--------|---------|------------\nImperfect     |-du     |fa-du    |si-du\nPerfect       |-dura   |fa-dura  |si-dura\nProgressive   |-dune   |fa-dune

more words, **Seltadu** and **Aghidu**, would fuse together and become part of its conjugation by the speaking of [Stonechild

interrogative pronouns used in place of an actor in a sentence in which said actor isn't known.\n\nIn Proto-Morellic, these unknown actors are represented by the Pronoun *\"Kiavi\" /kjä.vi/* with no animacy distinction as in English.\n\n#### When\n*When* is used as an interrogative adverb meaning \"During what time?\"\n\nIn Proto-Morellic, *When* is achieved through the adverb *\"saiim\" /sä.jim/*.\n\n#### Why\n*Why* is an interrogative adverb meaning \"caused by what?\"\n\nIn Proto-Morellic, *Why* is achieved through the word *\"Kiavur?\" /kjä.vur/* meaning \"for what / who;\" the dative form of previously mentioned *Kiavi*.\n\n#### How\n*How* is an interrogative adverb meaning \"in what manner / way?\"\n\nIn Proto-Morellic, *how* is achieved through the noun phrase *\"kiavur ren? /kjä.vur rɛn/* meaning \"in / at what?\"\n\n### Examples\n#### \"Owen is eating parsnips in the rain\"\n\n\u003e Uhkidune Oueni duombaset euslaur ren.\n\n/uç̠.kiˈdu.nɛ ɔˈwɛ.ni dwɔmˈbä.s̠ɛt
