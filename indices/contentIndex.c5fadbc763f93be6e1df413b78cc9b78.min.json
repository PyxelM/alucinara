The name is a larger term for many related cultural-ethenic groups, all descended from a common ancestor 7,000 years ago, known as the [Moráillona family](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md).\n\nThe original Moreillu tribe spoke [Proto-Morellic](languages/proto-morellic.md), and existed as a group of formerly nomadic minikin, who had settled in the mountains of the northeastern peninsula.\n\n- The creator created alucinara which created the realms (or suns, tar, darkness) which created the worlds which created the land and sea which created the mountains (or earth, dirt) which created the trees (or plants) which created the animals which created the people.\n- Alucinara, being the first thing the creator created, is a sacred energy which takes the form of alucinarium. It is the energy which initially gives life to newborns, defines the laws of nature and the universe, and allows animals to take the darkness for their own means.\n- The mountains also created the petrified child who indescriminately and infallibly destroys evil for the sake of our safety, and never destroys what does not deserve it.\n- The trees also created the mushroom goddess Omoza who created the mushrooms to give the people food, visions, and shelter from rain.\n- The tail is the most sacred limb of an animal, as it is the place where the soul resides.\n- When removed, the tail still houses the soul, which can only be released to the land of the dead by burning the tail. Otherwise burying the tail will trap it until it is destroyed when claimed by the deities to rot.\n- The fortuitary gland is the second most sacred part of one's body, as it allows one to take use of alucinara.\n- When removed, the fortuitary gland will still retain alucinara energy and a semblance of life until it begins to rot as the deities claim it, or it is burnt, in which case the alucinarium will react to light up with alucinara energy as it is released back into nature. \n- Female minikin are greater than male minikin, as female minikin are sacred enough to give birth to, nurse, and guide their litter. Male minikin cannot give birth to their litter as they are lesser than female minikin. It is because of this that the eldest female minikin should be the one to rule over their family or community as matriarch. Similarly, male minikin should not be permitted to act as spiritual leaders, as they are not as sacred as female minikin.\n- If someone is to steal, kill without reason, or take another's husband, cut their tail from them and bury it. This is because crime is reason enough to remove one's soul.\n- Squirrels are the ancestors of Minikin and are sacred animals because of this. They exist on land to watch and observe others, this is how the petrified child knows when and where evil is performed. As the descendants of squirrels, Minikin are also sacred animals.\n- Sacred animals should not be eaten for fear of the punishment of sickness and death, as they have been claimed by the deities in life.\n- Rotten meat has been claimed in death by the deities to be eaten, and should not be eaten by minikin for fear of punishment.\n- Mushrooms should only be eaten if they do not kill, as poisonous mushrooms are sacred and should not be eaten for fear of death.\n- A vision triggered by a mushroom is a sacred one, and should not be blasphemed. If a vision is not easily interpreted, one should go to a spiritual leader, and ask her to interpret it. She will place her hand on one's chest, interfacing with the sacred Alucinara energy within the Fortuitary Gland.\n- Snails are sacred animals, and have been claimed in life by the deities. This is why they have shells, to protect them from whosoever may kill them. Slugs are not sacred, as they have not been protected with a shell.\n- Similarly, fruit and nuts with shells or peels (such as oranges or bananas) should not be eaten, this is because they have also been claimed. This is why they have shells or peels, to protect them.\n- When eating an animal, its tail should not be eaten for fear of punishment, it should be rather cut off and burnt in fire. If the animal killed a minikin or a sacred animal before its death, its tail should be buried.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.427992488Z","tags":["cultures","morellic"]},"/deities/deities":{"title":"title","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## The Petrified Child\n[The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) is the deity who destroys evil.

It was formed from the mountains, owing to the fact that it is made of rock, and has the appearance of an infant. In addition, it is capable of travelling across the realms at its own discretion, and moves by quickly floating above the canopy or surface of the ground.\n\n## Appearance\n![Petrified Child](images/petrified-child.png)\n\nThe Petrified Child has the form of a long, inverse egg made of pure rock. It has a round top with a curved, tapering bottom, a vertical length of 3 metres, and a diameter of 1.5 metres at its widest point. In addition, it has no visible body parts except for a round infantile face on the front side of its upper section.\n\nIts face varies in shape over time due to the presence of Alucinara energy within it; this can cause its face to unpredictably shift in form. The child often appears to have the infantile face of a minikin, but it can also present with a strigine face, canine face, or a feline face, causing a lot of variation from culture-to-culture in how the deity is depicted.\n\nIts eyes are made of smooth Alucinarium bulbs, appearing dark, shiny, and purple. Round yellow-orange emissions of light appear and fade sporadically, a common visual phenomenon of crystalline Alucinarium, when its eyes are open. However, they are often closed to portray a wide, innocent smile with a look of contentment and calmness.\n\n### Cultural Variance\n- In [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a minikin;\n- In [dviri](cultures/dviri) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of an owl;\n- In [snixoj](cultures/snixoj) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a goat;\n- and in [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí) tradition, the petrified child is depicted with the face of a ferret.\n\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of the Petrified Child is to destroy evil where it may arise. The term 'evil' is not a term defined in the petrified child's mind, as to allow for a case-by-case conclusion on wether or not an offender needs to be destroyed.\n\nThe method by which the petrified child destroys is by disintegrating all but the offender's skeleton into an organic fertiliser known as 'Baby Sludge,' an alucinariferous substance far more conducive to plant growth and ecosystemic health than other fertilisers, due to its inherent volume of nutrients as well as magic influence.\n\n### Baby Meadows\nA 'Baby Meadow' is the term for the resulting oasis-like region that arises after baby sludge becomes incorporated into the earth. Following the destruction of evil, a baby meadow goes through three stages;\n\n#### Stage 1\nFollowing disintegration, the baby sludge settles on the ground and is partly absorbed into the soil. Little ecosystemic proliferation takes place in this stage, as the baby sludge is so severe that any flora or fauna in the vicinity will suffer from fungal or bacterial infection upon coming in contact with it.\n\nThis stage features mass ecological decline in the immediate area; the outward appearance of a baby meadow at this stage is that of a flat plain with a skeleton at its centre and decomposing trees, shrubbery, and animals scattered about.\n\n#### Stage 2\nThis is the stage at which the immediate danger has subsided, and nature begins to reclaim the area with greater ferocity than before. Alongside the proliferation of the local greenery, animals from other habitats may migrate to the area to feed upon the new food sources brought with the ecosystemic growth, especially if they are collecting food for hibernation.\n\nAlongside this appearance of new herbivorous fauna, predatory animals will similarly frequent the area in search of prey. Some predators, having smelled the appearance of baby sludge, will have shed their normal coats of fur over the first stage in favour of a coat of better camouflage, hiding in the brush until a prey animal walks by.\n\nThe appearance of this stage is similarly plain like the previous stage, but it otherwise features the proliferation of dense fruiting, blooming shrubbery, and the appearance of animals arriving to feed. At this point, moss, lichen, and vines will have begun growing on the skeletal remains, resulting in a characteristic green shade to the bones with blossoms growing from the surface.\n\n#### Stage 3\nThe final stage is the least dangerous relative to the previous stages, featuring little danger and little predators than wouldn't usually be expected. By this point, the ecosystemic proliferation will have ceased, and the health of the flora will sustain itself in the natural cycle of nutrients into plants and back into the ground.\n\nAt this point, the central skeleton may have rotted and crumbled, serving as fertiliser in and of itself, or it will have stayed standing in the case of stronger skeletons. The appearance of this stage is marked by the appearance of tall green trees; if the skeleton hasn't disappeared it will surely be hidden by the lush trees which will have grown in the area.\n\nFrom here on, the area will stay relatively constant in state, featuring dense flora. Over time the region may be overcome with other flora, resembling a baby meadow less and less after the initial propagation declines, but this is a very slow process due to the influence of alucinara energy in the area following the dissemination of baby sludge.\n\n## Detection of Evil\nThe petrified child detects evil through 'eyes' scattered across the realms. A fair proportion of these eyes exist naturally, but the majority of these eyes were carved by the [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) and [Stonechild](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md) minikin, after it was discovered they could be created manually.\n\n'Eyes' are rock formations given use by their physical resemblance to eyes or faces. They were discovered by an early [morellic](cultures/morellic.md) group of minikin who realised that the petrified child came to save them from danger only when there was a nearby cliff face or boulder with eyes formed into the surface.\n\nThe formation of these eyes is greatly helped by Alucinarium content in the rock, as this often causes the surface to shift into the shape of a face. This is often hastened by the process of erosion.\n\n### Watchstones\nOnce the morellic minikin had discovered this, they began to seek out rocks and carve faces into them, commonly as a good luck charm. These came to be known as '[Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md).'\n\nA lot of these rocks would be ineffective as they would be hidden away in a pocket, unable to see out of the fabric. So, the morellic minikin would sometimes cut holes in their pockets so that the eyes could see out.\n\nAn innovation came when early-stonechild minikin discovered that carving alucinarium geodes into watchstones worked to allow them to move, tremendously increasing the field of view of the watchstones. \n\n[^1]: 'uinh sëti-eyan' `DEF stone-child` 'the child of stone' ([P.M.](languages/proto-morellic.md))","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.427992488Z","tags":["supernatural-being","deity","petrified-child","featured"]},"/locations/nairu":{"title":"Náiru","content":"## Overview\nNáiru was an ancient city in the 2nd realm, and the capitol of the [Oyhóyunol Empire](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md).\n\n## Societal Structure\nNáiru, one of the first city-states, developed a caste system with 4 levels;\n- The highest level, the royals;\n- The second highest level, the nobles;\n- The second lowest level, the farmers;\n- And the lowest level, the soulless.\n\n### Royals\nThe royals relied wholly upon their servants, typically nobles, for food and riches.

They were spearheaded by the queen Nghoyúri[^2], who had helped Gesímhurën[^3] before. The split was partly motivated by a sense of disgust, as a lot of Moráillona minikin found the fall of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe to be cruel and tragic, especially Nghoyúri, who deeply regretted her actions in spite of Gesímhurën's pride. A lot of disgusted separatists joined the 'Akempali.\n\n### Reputation\nThe 'Akempali were seen as both a brave disadvantaged people, but also a separatist terrorist group who had succeeded from the Morellic tribe. They were persecuted by the Morellic people, and this influenced their migration north.\n\nApart from their political role, they were a tribe known for their wealth in livestock and food. They traded often with tribes they were on good terms with, and often sold animals in bulk for large amounts of money. This afforded them a reputation of wealth and power over their settled land.\n\n### Relationships\n#### Morellic\nThe 'Akempali's relationship with the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe was defined by hatred and persecution. The tribe persecuted the 'Akempali, and this created a burning disdain for the morellic people. The 'Akempali refused to trade with the morellic people, which greatly angered the tribe as they missed out on an element of the economy that a lot of other tribes were able to enjoy.\n\n#### Ováurmith\n\n\n#### Sníssol\n\n\n#### Ǫzí\nThe 'Akempali tribe's relationship with the [Ǫzí](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md) tribe was a complicated one; They were unsure of how to treat the Ǫzí nobles, but were on good terms with the natives. They tended to charge the nobles more in trade, as to take advantage of their wealth, and traded freely with the natives.\n\n### Migration\nRather than moving south, the 'Akempali moved north as to take advantage of the wildlife and resources of the area, and to move in the opposite direction of the Morellic tribe which they not only despised but were also persecuted by. They also tended for the eastern coast, constructing port cities mainly with western outposts along rivers.\n\n### Culture\n'Akempali culture was defined by a distinct sense of separateness, shown in their isolation from the other two morellic tribes. They differed from them in their departure from spiritualism, being one of the first groups to exhibit [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md)-abstainence. They saw alucinara and the deities as a dangerous tool not meant for minikin to wield, and that it was a law of nature that interfering with them would cause tragedy to follow.\n\n[^1]: means 'disgusted,' short for 'disgusted people'\n[^2]: means 'little crystal'\n[^3]: means 'hope'","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.543991704Z","tags":["c1ea","tribe","morellic"]},"/lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe":{"title":"The Morellic Tribe","content":"## Overview\nThe Morellic tribe, known as Moréillų[^1], was the continuation of the [Moráillona](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md) family after it grew and became larger following the destruction of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe. They spoke a dialect of [Proto-Morellic](lore/c1bd/languages/proto-morellic.md) known as [Old Morellic](lore/c1ea/languages/old-morellic.md).\n\n### Reputation\nThe reputation of the Morellic tribe varied across cultures. The majority opinion of the morellic tribe was that they were the underdogs which had taken power over their oppressors, a poor tribe that had redeemed itself out of poverty.\n\nThis reputation differed to most [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md)-abstaining tribes, such as the 'Akempali, who saw the Morellic tribe as being corrupted by alucinara and destined for collapse on account of their deep relationship with the deities.\n\n### Relationships\n#### 'Akempali\nThe Morellic relationship with the ['Akempali](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md) tribe was defined by disdain. The morellic tribe saw the 'Akempali as a simple terrorist separatist group, a people chasing false ideals and adhering to incomplete truths. They were persecuted by the Morellic tribe, influencing their migration north.\n\n#### Ǫzí\nThe Morellic relationship with the [Ǫzí](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md) tribe was shaky at best. The morellic people despised the noble ancestry in the population, seeing the Ǫzí nobles as the continuation of the Oyhóyunol tribe which had subjugated them in the past.\n\nHowever, the morellic people were sympathetic of the Ǫzí natives, drawing parallels between their own oppression and the oppression of the natives. Preceding the fall in the east, the Moráillona family would often trade with the Rwaránehru tribe, this served to provide a foundation for the relationship with the Ǫzí going forward, but a lot of morellic merchants would refuse to serve nobles.\n\n#### Ováurmith\n\n\n#### Sníssol\n\n\n### Migration\nDue to the fall of [Náiru](locations/nairu.md), it simply wasn't viable to inhabit the area with the anarchy of the uncontrolled citizenship. The morellic tribe, newly formed under the queenship of Pyanéirra[^2], the elder matriarch of the Moráillona family, was subsequently forced to flee their ancestral homeland.\n\n### Culture\nTheir culture was founded in the basis of their spiritualism, and a lot of early figures such as Gesímhurën[^3] and Ëbyámra[^4] were mythologised into ancient demi-gods, while figures such as Nghoiyúma, Djatúsa[^5], and Nghoyúri[^6] were mythologised into ancient pawns of evil.\n\nA lot of supernatural entities, living and non-living, would latch onto these cultural figures and give their worship legitimate power. This, compounded with the tribe's oral tradition of sharing information on how to interface with deities, rendered the morellic tribe as a people to be reckoned with.\n\n### The Split\nThe Moráillona family split into three tribes; the main group, with Pyanéirra at the helm, migrated south over the sarvaran gulf into the lower morellic peninsula. This would continue to be known as the Morellic tribe.\n\nThe other two morellic tribes would become to be known as\n- [The 'Akempali Tribe](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md);\n- and [The Ováurmith Tribe](lore/c1ea/ovaurmith-tribe.md).\n\n[^1]: means 'children of Mora,' the Morellic [goddess](deities/deities.md) of fungus.\n[^2]: means 'fighter'\n[^3]: means 'hope'\n[^4]: means 'cursed one'\n[^5]: means 'divine crystal' and 'lovely one'\n[^6]: means 'little crystal'","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.543991704Z","tags":["c1ea","tribe","morellic"]},"/lore/c1ea/ovaurmith-tribe":{"title":"The Ováurmith Tribe","content":"## Overview\nThe Ováurmith[^1] tribe began as a group of Moráillona minikin who had interbred with the Ilorrų́nolith following the southern migration.

They were led by a minikin known as Ngudhóro[^2], a noble who had gained power for his ability to manipulate, persuade and convince others. They had a great amount of influence over neighboring tribes.\n\n### Reputation\nThe Ǫzí tribe had a repution of cunning, deceit, and hoarding of wealth, owing to the Oyhóyunol influence. They were seen as a people who were very good at persuation, blackmail, and pressuring other groups into doing their own bidding.\n\n### Relationships\n#### Morellic\nThe Ǫzí relationship with the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe was defined by instability, a lot of nobles sought to repair their relationship with the morellic people but this was largely fruitless. The natives were afforded a great amount of freedom in trade, and cemented the Ǫzí people as 'business partners' in the morellic economy.\n\n#### 'Akempali\nThe Ǫzí natives would commonly trade with the ['Akempali](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md) tribe at fair prices, and the nobles would be expected to pay more for goods on account of their greater wealth and Oyhóyunol ancestry. This afforded a level of disdain that the nobled had for the 'Akempali, seeing the group as nothing more than stubborn.\n\nThis was a source of tention between the two Ǫzí castes, as the nobles were jealous of the natives. Regardless, trade in general benefitted both castes as they were one tribe; the relationship the two groups had was not favourable, but they benefitted eachother.\n\n#### Ováurmith\n\n\n#### Sníssol\n\n\n### Migration\nThe Ǫzí tribe inhabited the equatorial lakes, with the natives picking up from the Rwaránehru who had already inhabited the area and the nobles staying in the west following their assignment there and the eventual fall in the east.\n\n### Culture\nǪzí culture was the continuation of Oyhóyunol culture, although under a different banner due to the restructure of power, and the influence from the Rwaránehru. They developed two castes, Noble and Native. The noble caste was characterised by their presence in power, and the natives were characterised by their gender system and their diminished rights.\n\nIn Ǫzí culture, the subjugation of the native caste wasn't seen as a bad thing, but rather the logical continuation of the Rwaránehru. The neuter Rwaránehru worked to lay the philosophical foundation of the Ǫzí, and the Nobles took the foundation and built the new tribe atop it with their wealth and power.\n\n[^1]: means 'tribe,' short for 'tribe of nobles.'\n[^2]: means 'big worm'","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.543991704Z","tags":["c1ea","tribe","oyhoyunol"]},"/lore/c1ea/snissol-tribe":{"title":"The Sníssol Tribe","content":"## Overview\nThe Snissol[^1] tribe was the continuation of the 1st Century BD [Sëniksol](lore/c1bd/sëniksol-tribe.md) tribe.\n\n### Reputation\n\n### Relationships\n\n#### 'Akempali\n\n\n#### Morellic\n\n\n#### Ǫzí\n\n\n#### Ováurmith\n\n\n### Migration\n\n### Culture\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.543991704Z","tags":["c1ea","tribe"]},"/lore/c5ea/sarvaran-civilisation":{"title":"Sarvaran Civilisation","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n\n### Reputation\n\n### Relationships\n\n### Migration\n\n### Culture\n\n#### Religious Music\nSarvaran religious music took the form of an orchestra of three groups; the Singers, the Whistlers, and the Drummers, who would all perform on religious holidays and during evening worship every day.\n\n##### Tuning\nSarvaran religious music followed a handful of tuning systems, but the majority of songs followed [an altered form of 8-TET](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/?n=8%20Almost-Equal%20Divisions\u0026l=5k._8c._ci._fa._ku._p0._rs._xc.\u0026c=~-~~-~~-\u0026f=b4\u0026a=3\u0026y=1hr\u0026s=0\u0026r=bv\u0026version=2.1.0).

They would often take their lyrics from the epic stories that defined Sarvaran mythology.\n\nThey would not use [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) to add effects to their voices, as legibility was key to getting across the story of each song they were to play.\n\n##### Whistlers\nThe whistlers would form the main lead of each song, using overtone singing to create loud, high-pitched tones that would ring out about the temple.\n\nThe whistlers would use alucinara to alter the timbre of their singing, introducing audio effects like tremelo by altering the air pressure in their mouths.\n\n##### Drummers\nThe drummers would beat drums along to the song, forming the rhythmic foundation of each song. Their purpose was to introduce an element to the song reminiscent of natural chaos, and would often reflect the song's themes in their intensity and rhythm.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.543991704Z","tags":["c5ea","civilisation","morellic"]},"/lore/history":{"title":"History","content":"## Creation\nAt first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The material of the void was Darkness, a pitch-black substance made of hydrocarbons. There were two consciousnesses in the void, the first Judge and the second, who existed to create the universe.\n\nThe first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they cleared the void of darkness, designed planets, stars, elements, and each their roles in the universe.\n\nStars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a fast steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which predestined the universe to appear as an art piece. Beautiful, ornamental, and not meant for living inhabitants.\n\n### Life\nHowever, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of their own; *life*. Life was created in the form of the Darklings - creatures made of darkness, hidden from light so that they would not be discovered.\n\nThe darklings immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the natural laws not built for them. They built empires founded on the backs of planets, and sucked the light out of stars for energy, so that the darkness could spread, and so that they could continue to go undiscovered.\n\n### Darklings' Mistake\nEventually, the darklings grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the first judge once the last star was gone. The first judge was furious when it had discovered them, disgusted and mortified that matter could move and take reality for its own interests, never to aid nature.\n\nIn an apocalyptic turn of events, the first judge shattered the walls of reality as it tried in vain to push off the darklings, and it was unfortunately subsumed by the mass of living darkness.\n\n## Aftermath\nAlmost immediately, the second judge created the [second laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a last-ditch attempt to save its companion, but it was too late, and only served to worsen the shattered new reality. In the first judge's last moments, it turned itself [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), an infinite form of energy that would allow the first laws to live on within the second laws, allowing its legacy to continue.\n\n### The Darklings\nIt also banished the darklings to the void-space that surrounded every small bubble of reality left. It defined their place in the universe, that they would never be able to destroy the world unfettered once more. Without alucinara energy, that would bring the first laws of nature back into effect, the darklings would be rendered a simple tar - with no thoughts and no intentions, a product of the second laws.\n\nThe first judge resolved to turn their existence into some good - it had created the *soul*.\n\n### The Soul\nThe Darklings were then turned into Souls, which are Darkness under effects of Alucinara. It was created so that the darklings could only touch reality by fuelling the good of an innocent creature, and could never do anything without the limits of a biochemical host.\n\nThe soul could only manifest as amino acids, or other organic compounds such as tar, when in contact with alucinara. This is what gives organisms such as animals and plants life - the amino acids in their bodies interacts with aluicnara to create thought and intention.\n\nWithout alucinara, darklings would only appear as organic compounds *without* the capacity for thought, as the second laws of nature weren't built to perpetuate the soul. They often appear as the natural substance tar, being given their own place in the universe such as in tar pits and resin.\n\n### The Realms\nIn the universe's final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more succeptible to the effects of the [first laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md).\n\nOne could shift from realm to realm by creating [alucinara gateways](phenomena/alucinara-gateway), the process getting more alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.\n\n## Heirarchy of Beings\nIn the new realms, things began to settle. The threat of further shattering decreased to zero, and stars began to flare once more into eternal brightness. New things began to be created, as well, things that were impossible under the old laws.\n\n### Planets\nFor example, planets formed into largely static mounds of dust and minerals. Given enough tar were present in one, and given enough alucinara energy was nearby, a soul could be formed within. One such soul was [Qerhel](deities/qerhel.md), who resided within the planet of the same name, within the 2nd realm.\n\n### Mountains and Oceans\nIn addition, a soul could divide and its new children could take a smaller, more specified, element of their parent as a host. The two elements that a child could take a hold of were the land and sea, each child soul residing within one or more mountains or oceans.\n\n### Biomes\nFurther division could occur, and the ways for a soul to manifest became larger. An ocean soul could divide into a coral reef, an abyss, or a kelp forest. Likewise, a mountain soul could divide into a land forest, a desert, or another biome. In some cases, a mountain soul could even divide into a creature capable of movement.\n\n### Higher-Order Creatures\nFor example, a creature formed from a mountain is [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), which is made of a large, floating, alucinarium geode. It is externally visible as a rock with the face of a child, and became revered as a deity in many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.\n\nCreatures formed from mountains are known as higher-order creatures, to distinguish them from lower-order creatures such as animals and nonliving phenomena such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md).\n\n### Lower-Order Creatures\nLower order creatures, formed from the biomes, are animals such as ruminants, birds, reptiles, or minikin, et cetera. They are the most common of the souls, as they are able to create new physical bodies with the process of reproduction; this is a very effective stategy, due to the short lifespans of their physical bodies and likelyhood of disability compared to other souls.\n\nSome lower-order creatures can live for very long, however, especially when aided with the help of alucinara energy. Some even make use of alucinara with help of the fortuitary gland, although this is rare in the 0th and nearby realms.\n\nHumans are the most common creature in the 0th realm, [Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md) the most common in the 1st, [Dragons](species/fauna/dragons.md) the most common in the -1st, [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) the most common in the 2nd, [Quartz Mice](species/fauna/quartz-mice.md) the most common in the -2nd, [Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md) the most common in the 3rd, and [Wormwolves](species/fauna/wormwolves.md) the most common in the -3rd.\n\n### Nonliving Phenomena\nNonliving phenomena are the result of alucinara interacting with matter without the presence of a soul. When alucinara is used in a soul, the patterns that come with being an animal are drilled into the energy like muscle memory, leading to the [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle).\n\nWhen alucinara interacts with nonliving matter with the principle in effect, it will cause the matter to act as if it were an animal, attempting to fight, eat, and drink, all with no benefit. Some nonliving phenomena are commonplace, such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md), [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md), or [sky islands](phenomena/sky-islands.md).\n\n## Species of the Realms\nIn every realm, many many species had developed. The specieses of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with alucinara energy. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.\n\n### The Supernova of 80MB\nIn 80MB[^1], the shockwave of a far-off supernova had finally reached the Earth. The star that had caused it was extremely old, having retained a lot of alucinara from the energy left over from the shattering of the realms.\n\nThere was virtually no destruction on that day, but the main outcome was mass-frequencial shift of the animals and plants affected. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into different realms. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.\n\n### New Species\n- [The Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md)\n- [The Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md)\n- [The Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md)\n\n## The History of the 2nd Realm\n\n\n[^1]: MB means 'Millenia Before (the fall of Nairu.)''

It refers to any event after the fall of the Oyhóyunol empire. The opposite abbreviation is BD, standing for 'Before Destruction.'\n\n## 1st Century BD\nThe 1st century BD ended with the breaking off of the [*Moráillona*](cultures/morellic.md)[^1] family from the larger [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md)[^2] tribe, which was destroyed, into the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe.\n\n### The Oyhóyunol Empire\nThe Oyhóyunol tribe was spearheaded by the [Motúdjas](lore/c1bd/families/motudjas-family.md)[^3] dynasty, ruled by a pair of deformed twin sisters, Nghoiyúma and Djatúsa[^4]. The twins were based in the city of [Náiru](locations/nairu.md)[^5], the capitol of the Oyhóyunol empire, which spanned from the eastern coast of the central continent through to the border of the [Rwaránehru](lore/c1bd/rwaranehru-tribe.md)[^6] tribe and their equatorial lakes.\n\n### The Fall of Oyhóyunol\nDue to the twinship of Nghoiyúma and Djatúsa, they shared one soul, and once Nghoiyúma was murdered by her armour-bearer for power, Djatúsa was overcome with magic; her one body now held the [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy of two.\n\nThis drove Djatúsa mad, and her lifespan, insanity, and strength were augmented by twice as much as before. She began to make irrational decisions, and her city's stability and economy was deeply affected.\n\nEventually, in desparation, a lot of the citizens of Náiru began to turn to crime, stealing food just to survive. This dramatically increased the crime level, and also increased the amount of soulless in the population, as tail removal was a common punishment for theft (although most criminals were simply executed).\n\n#### Gesímhurën's Brother\nNow there was a minikin named Ëbyámra[^7], brother of a minikin named Gesímhurën[^8], both of the Farmer family of Moráillona. The house of Moráillona was very spiritual, and each member was raised in an environment where they learned of how to interface with [the deities](deities/deities.md), [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), and [laws of the universe](phenomena/natural-laws.md).\n\nËbyámra had stolen a lot of fruit from another farmer, as his harvest had run dry. In fact, he had taken every fruit from one of the farmer's trees; a crime of theft. Ëbyámra knew the risks, but decided to steal regardless, as his wife had just given birth to a litter which they couldn't afford to feed.\n\nThis was immediately reported upon discovery, and it didn't take long for the Náiruan guards to sniff out Ëbyámra's scent upon the tree, among other blatant pieces of evidence such as torn clothes on branches.\n\n#### His Execution\nThe trial was swift and unfair, despite the correctness of the guilty verdict. Djatúsa interfered to take express control, taking great joy in the torture and execution of Ëbyámra for what she percieved to be *'a horrid corruption of the purity of her great city.'* His death was characterised by a flagrant exercise of violence, suffering made manifest by [the crystal](phenomena/alucinara.md)'s influence on the Queen.\n \nThe entire Moráillona family was distraught at the loss; it was even worse that they couldn't openly perform the traditional grieving rituals for fear of disfigurement, torture, or punishment by the queen who took him for the *betterment of the city*.\n\nOne ambitious member of the family named Gesímhurën, Ëbyámra's sister, felt like she couldn't let this be it; she couldn't let her brother lie in a pit of gemstones with other cursed souls 4 lengths under the surface. She had to do something.\n\n#### The Plan\nUsing her knowledge of [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), she made a plan to bring vengeance and true justice to Djatúsa. She would create an extensive system of [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) in and around the Royal Tree of Náiru, so that [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) might see the evil of the queen and her servants and destroy them.\n\nShe performed this plan with her cousin, Nghoyúri[^9]. Nghoyúri carved eyes into pebbles, Gesímhurën carved eyes into the bark of the tree and the clay of the shelters, and both of them placed the pebbles that Nghoyúri had made about the tree.\n\nIn order to appear innocuous, they pretended to be Soulless, merely servants cleaning the walkways and ornaments with their tails shaven and tucked away as to appear amputated, despite how embarassing it would be, and how it would affect how they were treated, to appear so lowly.\n\n#### The Aftermath\nThe destruction of the queen and her servants was a success, but many innocent people were also affected in a tragic play of events. The night after the plan unfolded, as Gesímhurën slept, a baby meadow was created in the royal tree.\n\nThe result was that the royal offices of Náiru were rendered unusable, as the baby sludge would surely blight anyone who stepped in it. Djatúsa was killed, likewise for her servants - all but a small group of Nobles who were out on an diplomatic campaign.\n\nNáiru was thrown into chaos, with no queen and no forseeable heir, the Motúdjas dynasty was destroyed in but a night, and there was no centre of power to stablise the guards and citizenship. This led to the swift fall of the Oyhóyunol tribe and its empire.\n\n## 1st Century EA\nMany groups arose from the ashes of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe, especially the [Moráillona](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md) family. The destruction of Oyhóyunol ended the suppression of many of their former citizens, allowing many lowly families to gain more power, fight for control, and win it.\n\nMany groups rose following the fall of the Oyhóyunol tribe, including but not limited to;\n- [The Morellic Tribe](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md);\n- [The 'Akempali Tribe](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md);\n- [The Ǫzí Tribe](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md);\n- [The Ovaurmith Tribe](lore/c1ea/ovaurmith-tribe.md);\n- And [The Snissol Tribe](lore/c1ea/snissol-tribe.md).\n\n[^1]: means 'children of Mora,' the Morellic [goddess](deities/deities.md) of fungus.\n[^2]: means 'inhabitants of the wilderness'\n[^3]: means 'weasel,' or 'stalker'\n[^4]: means 'divine crystal' and 'lovely one'\n[^5]: means 'market,' short for 'market in the forest'\n[^6]: means 'Western Lake'\n[^7]: means 'cursed one'\n[^8]: means 'hope'\n[^9]: means 'little crystal'","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["lore"]},"/materials/wood":{"title":"title","content":"%%\nWhat is it?\nWhat does it do?\nWhat does it look / sound / smell like?\nWhat is it used for?\nWhat is its cultural significance?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nWood is the main organic material of trees.

Alucinara causes this by altering the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) to act in place of the ordinary [Second Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md).\n\n## Appearance\nAlucinara energy itself is accompanied by the creation of short-lived orange orbs and sparks nearby. Although it is colourless itself, it often appears as a purple aura - this is due to the purple-shifting of light that passes through its energy fields.\n\nAlucinarium, the mineral in which the energy is stored, appears semi-translucent, dark purple, and shines orange, easily cleaving off into dust. Due to the alucinara energy that is stored and emitted from the mineral, it is often accompanied by the orbs, sparks, and purple aura.\n\n## Effects\nAlucinara causes effects such as;\n- Levitation of objects or living beings, where the effects of gravity will be altered in direction or intensity.\n- Frequencial Shift, where an object or living being will be transported into another realm. This is often accomplished by the presence of an [Alucinara Gateway](phenomena/aluicnara-gateway.mc).\n- Emission of light, where an object will emit glowing sparks or orbs which dim over time;\n- The [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle), where inanimate objects will act like living animals;\n- The Soul, where alucinara energy will interact with hydrocarbons in pitch or amino acids to create consciousness;\n- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo the growth of alucinarium crystals on the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary frequencial shift.\n- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo growth of alucinarium crystals upon the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary frequencial shift.\n\n### Influence on Biology\nAlucinara's effect on biology is characterised by growth of unhealthy crystals on the body, extension of an organisms lifetime, and utilisation of the unnatural properties of the energy.\n\nUtilisation of Alucinara has been convergently evolved numerous times in the history of biology, with its basis in the development of the 'Fortuitary Gland' - a gland dedicated to the regulation of alucinarium purity and content in the blood. It often aids the capability of alucinara use;\n- In sapient species, alucinara use has similarities to tool use, such as using alucinara to ignite fires, light areas, and manipulate objects.\n- In less sapient species such as plants, fungus, and most animals (and to a lesser extent, sapient species), alucinara use is expressed as a biological process. For example, it can be employed in involuntary defence mechanisms, such as bursts of light, to stun predators, or creation of force fields, to push them away.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["phenomena","alucinara"]},"/phenomena/cloud-gnats":{"title":"Cloud Gnats","content":"## Overview\nCloud Gnats are animal-like apparitions made of [alucinariferous](phenomena/alucinara.md) dust. They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of alucinara energy, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.\n\nThey can pose a violent threat, as their crystalline claws or teeth can cause lacerations, infection, and a risk of phantasmarrhoea if a shard of alucinarium were to break off in the wound.\n\n![Cloud Gnat](images/cloud-gnat.png)\n\n## Appearance\nCloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty and purple, with an average length of 22cm. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail. In addition, they sometimes exhibit dark-purple [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) crystals in the place of eyes, claws, or teeth, with a solid appearance which stands out against their bodies' dusty material.\n\nIn addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature floating emissive bulbs in front of where their eyes would be.\n\n## Behaviour\nWhile cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour; this is because the pseudo-fauna principle affects behaviour as well as appearance. This is the root of cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will try to retain alucinara energy and attack living beings in order to replenish it.\n\nThis can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection or phantasmarrhoea if shards broke off in the wound. Thankfully, they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.\n\n## Lifespan\nCloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.\n\nA length of roughly 22cm is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws":{"title":"The First Laws of Nature","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nThe first laws of nature were the rules which reality abided by preceding creation.

In addition, larger-scale features can develop, such as the overall shape of the sky island to warp into the body plan of an animal.\n\nFurthermore, sky islands show a tendancy to take the form animals according to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md). As sky islands float, they may take the form of avian animals such as birds or bats, or may take the form of aquatic animals such as whales or fish.\n\n## Feeding Habits\nWhile sky islands aren't alive, they need to be fed with alucinara energy to stay afloat, and hunt alucinariferous animals or plants to refuel according to the pseudo-fauna principle.\n\nA common hunting practice is that the sky islands may be drawn to areas of high-alucinarium content, such as communities of animals or crystalline mountains. They swoop from high altitude  down, and catch any sources of alucinara in their mouths which shift open as they descend.\n\nIf an animal is eaten, then the alucinarium present in their body will be absorbed into the rock as decomposition takes place. Once all that is left is bone, the bone will be naturally moved deeper into the rock itself as the stone shifts. This can cause high concentrations of calcium in the rock, and this can cause vast large stalagtites of calcium carbonate to form.\n\n## Stalagtites\nThese stalagtites hang from the underside of the sky islands, reaching large sizes. Due to the pseudo-fauna principle, these stalagtites may even warp vaguely into a shape reminiscent of a minikin, an other animal, or trees.\n\n### Spikefalls\nOnce the stalagtites reach a large enough size, they can fall from the sky islands in an event known as a Spikefall. Due to their large mass, wide, dusty, vast craters form once they reach the ground. While a lot of the stalagtite is vapourised on impact, the large scale of them can lead to the more stable inner rock staying intact.\n\nThe more stable rock tends to take a more clarified shape of what the stalagtites were before impact. Whereas a minikinoid stalagtite may have a smooth indistinct surface on the sky island itself, once fallen the exess is broken away and there is left colossal structures at the centre of each crater.\n\n### Stalagtite Communities\nIf found, some craters are converted into communities, cities, or towns. The central structure is commonly the basis of a deity, and these fallen stalagtites are often worshipped by those who live around them.\n\nIn addition, some crater communities carve houses or structures into the fallen stalagtites, creating walkways through the stone and balconies at the side, while others create wooden or clay buildings around the main structure. Some communities do both, and create walkways and/or connections from the carved structures into the external ones.\n\n#### Notable Stalagtite Communities\n- [Cratertown](locations/cratertown.md), a town inhabited by [Dviri](cultures/dviri.md) minikin, built around an indistinct-shaped stalagtite.\n- [City of the Fallen One](locations/city-of-the-fallen-one.md), a religious site of the [Ǫzí](cultures/Ǫzí.md) minikin, built around a minikinoid stalagtite.\n- [Amanitaville](locations/amanitaville.md), the capital of [Morelland](locations/morelland.md), built around a mushroom-shaped stalagtite.\n\n### Notable Sky Islands\n- The Birds,\n\t- Aderyn Major, the largest sky island to record\n\t- and Aderyn Minor;\n- The Bats,\n\t- Ystlum Primus,\n\t- Ystlum Secundus, the most bloodthirsty sky island to record\n\t- and Ystlum Tertius;\n- The Whales,\n\t- Morvilog Major\n\t- and Morvilog Minor, the most peaceful sky island to record;\n- and The Worms,\n\t- Abwyd Primus, the longest sky island to record,\n\t- Abwyd Secundus,\n\t- Abwyd Tertius, the smallest sky island to record\n\t- and Abwyd Quartus.\n\n#### Aderyn Major\nAderyn Major, the largest sky island to record, takes the shape of a bird and has been inhabited by the Nesi and Stonechild Imperial Minikin. Originating from the central continent, Aderyn Major has been found and colonised by many central continent peoples.\n\n##### Discovery by the Ǫzí Minikin\nOnce, Aderyn Major crash-landed, having ran out of Alucinara Energy. A group of minikin known as the Ǫzí minikin found Aderyn Major's remains and began to inspect it but, in a turn of tragic fate, one group of minikin entered the mouth of the sky island and tragically died to the ravenous ecosystem inside.\n\nWhen the alucinarium inside of the victims' bodies was released, the sky island took full advantage of this - immediately springing to animation, with the rest of the Ǫzí minikin on its back. It soon began to float upward, taking its place as the home of the Nesi Minikin, who broke off from the Ǫzí.\n\n##### Conquest by the Empire of the Petrified Child\nCenturies later, by the time of the Stonechild Era, the empire had begun to take advantage of their new technology of alucinara-powered flight. Using an airship of theirs, they attacked the island - burning and pillaging the town of Aderynville and taking control of Birton, claiming it as the capital of their Aderyn Major Province.\n\nFollowing the conquest, two social classes formed, as is usual with stonechild colonialism - the Blue class and the Orange class. The blue class was named for the stonechild officers' blue attire, and the orange class for the remaining Nesi minikin's orange attire.\n\nFor centuries going forward, the Empire of the Petrified Child would control the island, policing entry and exit, taxing the inhabitants, converting them to [Stonechildism](religions/stonechildism.md), and mistreating them. However, once the empire fell, outside resources were scarce - the blues attempted to keep control, convincing themselves that the empire couldn't *truly* be gone, but it was too late.\n\n##### Fall of the Empire\nEventually, the blues formed their own state, not letting themselves succumb to the mounting resistence that was ready to burst in the wake of the political instability of the time. This was what would be known as the [True Sovereign State of Aderyn Major of the Petrified Child](locations/2nd-realm/the-aderyn-state.md), often shortened to just 'The Aderyn State.'\n\nA queen was appointed of the highest-ranking officer of the island, beginning a matrilineal line of succession as each generation took the mantle of controlling the island.\n\nAs time went on, the unrest of the island calmed, as the blues became more and more comfortable with feeding dissenters to the belly of the island. However - stonechild influence on the island dimished over time, albeit slowly over centuries.\n\n##### Rise of the Nesi Minikin\nOver time, the class divide grew to become a mere suggestion. As the culture of the island developed and evolved and diverged, ","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["phenomena","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/phenomena/watchstones":{"title":"Watchstones","content":"\n## Overview\nWatchstones[^1] are artificial patrols invented by the [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) minikin for the purpose of giving [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) a greater visual range. They are rocks with eyes or faces carved into them, commonly made from [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) geodes. They served as one of the first examples of mass-production by the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild.md).\n\nWatchstones with the ability to move imprint on the closest animal, observing to see if the animal carries out an evil action or an evil action is carried out against it. Due to their animalistic behaviour as defined by the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), Watchstones with the ability to move are often taken as pets or companions in spite of their lack of a soul.\n\n![Watchstone](images/watchstone.png)\n\n## Utility\nWatchstones are given use by the presence of eyes on the surface of rock as the petrified child has the ability to see out of every pair of eyes carved or eroded into rock formations. This is the mechanism which the petrified child uses to detect evil.\n\nBefore watchstones began to be carved out of geodes, they were motionless and static despite their effectiveness. This meant a lot of watchstones would be hidden away in pockets as a good luck charm, but this proved ineffective. This led to the cutting of holes into pockets and the specific fabrication of places such as lockets and cases to place watchstones within; this allowed watchstones to serve their purpose more effectively.\n\nThey are often given other facial features in addition to their eyes, this practice began as artistic chiselling by the sarvaran minikin but eventually proved to increase the effectiveness and field of view of watchstones, becoming the standard by the time of the Empire of the petrified child.\n\n## Appearance\nWatchstones have the appearance of a chiselled pair of eyes / a face upon a hard rock or pebble. When carved from alucinarium geodes, watchstones can additionally feature an internal orange glow visible from the thinner parts of the surface.\n\nIn addition, they can feature physically separate 'legs' used to aid the process of floatation; large rocks or geodes form the main bodies of watchstones, and smaller alucinariferous pebbles form the legs.\n\n### Legs\nThese legs are made of pebbles taken from the ground, continually picked up with magic and put down when their inherent alucinara energy has been used up. They aid the process of floatation in that, being in contact with the ground, they can act as leverage against the force of gravity. This means that less alucinara energy is used up by the watchstone, and continuous floatation is sustainable.\n\n### Pebbles\nPebbles continually accumulate alucinarium over time due to alucinara energy present in the air, and lose their alucinara energy when in use by watchstones. This is why legs are discarded and fall over after a period of use, and why new ones are naturally picked up.\n\nIn some areas, the amount of energy is negligible, but in others - such as next to a crystalline alucinarium deposit - pebbles can become greatly saturated with the mineral to the point of geode formation; they are taken as legs at the mid-point of this process.\n\n[^1]: 'uinh eyanitu atëmil' `DEF stone-PL see-STV` 'the seeing stones' ([P.M.](languages/proto-morellic.md))","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["petrified-child","pseudo-fauna","featured"]},"/species/fauna/demi-slugs":{"title":"Demi-Slugs","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDemi-Slugs are a nomadic sapient gastropod species native to the 1st realm. They are herbivores, eating leaves and soft plant tissue. They live in societies built around the ceremonial and survivalistic foraging of plants and defense from other animals.\n\n## Adaptations\nAfter the Supernova of 80MB, a great portion of slugs were shifted into the 1st realm. These new inhabitants were almost immediately hunted by the native avian species, leading to the adaptation of;\n- legs akin to the tentacles of octopodes, to aid in evasion,\n- greater visual acuity, to make it easier to notice predators,\n- and tougher skin, as to withstand pathogens and wounds.\n\n## Morphology\nDemi-slugs were small stocky creatures, about 20 cm tall at adulthood and 1\u003c cm tall in infancy. They lack a shell, featuring a textured patch on their backs, and have a pneumostome which they used to breathe at the centre of their chests. They eat using a radula, a tongue-like organ used to scrape up plant matter into the mouth.\n\nThey also featured four antennae on their heads, two outward facing tentacles projecting from the sides of their top lip which they used to smell and taste, and two eyes on stalks at the top of the head.\n\nTheir eyes had much greater visual definition than their slug ancestors, and developed a mechanism similar to blinking in minikin; they would retract the bulb of their eyes into the stalk, refreshing the organ and reducing the risk of dessication greatly.\n\nThey appeared to have six bulky limbs projecting from the sides of the foot, analogous to the tentacles of octopodes. They had two legs, two arms, and two 'inbetween' limbs. They also featured a small tail connected to the 'foot,' which touched the ground and helped with their semi-bipedal balance. The arms featured four small bumps on their end akin to three fingers and a thumb.\n\n## Diet\nThe Demi-slugs grew from herbivorous leaf-eating slugs, widening their diet into the consumption of;\n- leaves,\n- soft branches,\n- soft roots,\n- and fruit.\n\nTheir new deit helped them to reach the point they achieved, bringing them more nutrients than they would have needed previously, affording them greater energy to spend toward developing and maintaining mutations and their intricacies.\n\n## Sociality\nAll of the evolutionary adaptations worked in conjunction with alucinara to quickly augment and improve the physiologies of their basal slug ancestors as well as their minds; they quickly developed an upright stance and the ability to coordinate and communicate.\n\nThis led to the formation of many nomadic communities in the 1st realm, all concerned with serving deities and survival, with little technological advancement due to the constant pressure from predators in the hot plains with no places to hide.\n\n### Communities\nNomadic demi-slug communities tended to live in temporary complexes built undergound into the soil and built above it with clay and mud that would be gathered, stored in the mouth, and deposited.\n\nTheir communities often had their nursery rooms deep in the ground, their pantries in hard-to-open rooms just below the surface, and their lounging areas above the ground where it could be easy to leave for the sacred gathering of food.\n\n### Clothing\nDemi-slug clothing tended to be very basal, as the species' lack of precise fingers made weaving nigh-impossible. Rather, they would tan leaves and glue them together to wear them like a poncho, reserving the toughest leaves for the chest as to protect the pseumostome.\n\n### Religion\nIt was often considered that foraging, gathering, and defense were all methods of worship endowed to the demi-slugs as rules of their existence. They were incredibly devout creatures, always acting to serve their deities.\n\nTheir spiritual leaders tended to consume [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) in powder or paste form, treating the elevated level of consciousness achieved as the 'spiritual plane' where one could interface with deities or passed loved ones. It was treated as a taboo for a common demi-slug to do so without permission, as it could lead to [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) or incorrect interpretation.\n\nSpiritual leaders of typically every species tended to be blind, with light purple-tinted eyes. This was a result of continued exposure to alucinarium and its effects on physiology.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["species","fauna","slug"]},"/species/fauna/djidjit":{"title":"Djidjit","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["species","fauna","skipper"]},"/species/fauna/dragons":{"title":"Dragons","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nDragons, native to the 2nd realm, are a small amphibian species capable of flight.

They were arboreal omnivores which tended toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They were capable of language, and appeaedr anthropoid.\n\n## Adaptation\nMany red squirrels that had found themselves in the 2nd realm as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and were subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;\n- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,\n- greater agility and capacity for stealth,\n- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.\n\n## Morphology\nMinikin measured at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.\n\nThey also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same alucinara energy that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.\n\n### Fur Distribution\nHairlessness and / or fur distribution could vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tended to have hair, and the tail was always fuzzy and bushy.\n\nFor example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin were almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin were hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.\n\n### Eyes\nMinikin skin colour could vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour could vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.\n\n## Diet\nAs omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;\n- insects,\n- berries,\n- nuts,\n- leaves,\n- tree bark,\n- and small rodents.\n\nSome minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.\n\n## Sociality\nMinikin often tended to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin would exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's midden(s).\n\n### Communities\nAs they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or middens.\n\nMinikin groups would inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees were often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.\n\n### Taboos\nWhen a minikin commited a crime, they would be ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails were seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and the disconnection from the soul was representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' could vary depending on each culture's taboos.\n\n### Instability\nWhen a group got too large for one community, it would inevitably collapse. Two or three new groups could form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups were often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.\n\n## Psychology\nMinikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucinarium secretion and frequencial shift.\n\nHowever, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, were greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.\n\n### Hibernation\nAll minikin hibernated in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin became unconscious in a sleep-like state and alucinarium levels in the brain would increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protected the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.\n\nThis was not seen in minikin sleep, but was shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucinarium in the brain during hibernation was a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["species","fauna","rodent","featured"]},"/species/fauna/silkmoths":{"title":"silkmoths","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":[]},"/species/fauna/snails":{"title":"snails","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/botanists":{"title":"Botanists","content":"%%\nWhat are the significant features which make this relevant to the plot?\nWhat patterns are there when it comes to description and properties?\nWhat does it look like, what is its relevance, and what is it used for?\n%%\n\n## Overview\nBotanists grew to inhabit the 3rd realm, and they buckled the trend of *animals* taking the sentient role in an ecosystem. In fact, Botanists are plants; rather than eating, they employ Alucinaratrophy, absorbing alucinara energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.\n\nThey did little to adapt to their surroundings, apart from the development of toxins and thorns to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat them. Rather, the bulk of their evolution came from the bombardment of alucinara they recieved during their development, speeding up the process and applying drastic physiological changes.\n\nThe botanists took on a radial body plan, with 6 to 8 thorned roots at the bottom of their bodies. Once reaching maturity, these roots would leave the ground and serve as legs, so that the botanists cold place their seeds far away. In addition, they featured a skirt of very many leaves specialised for alucinaratrophy and four eyes on stalks around a long tendril that laid retracted in a mouth-like pouch on a long thorned neck at the top of the body. The tendril would come out when object manipulation was needed, or when it was time to release seeds, which would also be stored in the pouch.\n\nThe botanists had a semi-sophisticated society, mirroring insects such as ants or termites, where all will serve a purpose in the colony, communicating with the use of pheromones released from the mouth-pouch. Colonies would be planted by a group of mature botanists, plunging their tendrils into the soil to lay their seeds deep in the ground, which wouch eventually grow into a patch and go on to plant more and more colonies.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":["species","fauna","fernfolk"]},"/species/flora/skunkfruit":{"title":"skunkfruit","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":[]},"/species/flora/thirrist":{"title":"thirrist","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T19:30:56.547991677Z","tags":[]},"/species/fungi/mushrooms":{"title":"Mushrooms","content":"\n## Overview\nMushrooms are the fruiting bodies of many fungal species.
