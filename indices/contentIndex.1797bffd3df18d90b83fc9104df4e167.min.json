He would use the [Old Sarvaran](languages/morellic/sarvaran/old-sarvaran.md) logographs in the margins of his maps, but eventually decided to standardise his logographs as to be more organised, but this spread throughout the whole Sarvaran civilisation, military first, as the use of Amkani's maps influenced the writing of the many generals and eventually common people of the civilisation.","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T21:25:16.320350041Z","tags":null},"/cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/stonechild-empire":{"title":"Empire of the Petrified Child","content":"\n# Language\nThe lingua franca of the Empire of the Petrified Child was [Stonechild Imperial](languages/morellic/stonechild-imperial/stonechild-imperial.md).","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T21:25:16.320350041Z","tags":null},"/cultures/snixian/snixia/snixia":{"title":"Snixia","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T21:25:16.320350041Z","tags":null},"/flora/thirrists/thirrists":{"title":"Thirrists","content":"\nThirrists are small tri-segmented citrus fruits of the realm of [2°e](locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md).\n\n# Growth\nThirrist Plants start out as 1 of 3 seeds contained in the centre of a Thirrist fruit and, once in the ground, begin to germinate - eventually becoming short, wide trees.\n\nBeginning as orange-yellow flowers, once pollinated, these flowers grow into green fruits.
