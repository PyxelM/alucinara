## Overview
Life is a state of being characterised by the presence of a [soul](cosmology/darkness.md) and an animate body. Beings which are alive are known as living beings or essents. An essent gains life at birth, at which point a soul is made manifest in the physical body via the [dreamscape](cosmology/dreamscape.md); [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) is a crucial element in this process.
## Animitis
When more than one identical essent is born at once (as in monozygotic twins), each twin is given a whole part of one individual soul; so, identical twins share the same soul. When one twin dies, their part of the soul is given to the nearest other twin, which can lead to a condition called [Animitis](conditions/animitis.md), a condition defined by the overabundance of a singular soul within one living being. Symptoms of such are delusions of grandeur, psychosis, and the fracturing of one's identity.
