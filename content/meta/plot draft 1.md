#### 'We, The Blight'
*O my friends, who are so fragile,
who made us for worlds like this one?*

*There is no conclusion made here,
none at all, that have much meaning.
For it's vain to say whoever made us
made us right, for good and greatness.

*We are right to say we're broken,
made to break, to end our hunger.
Hunger does destroy this nature,
nature made for beauty only.

*We, the blight, we greed and hunger,
mould we are, and mould we will too.
But we aren't to blame for all this.
We are fruit of shattered, flawed worlds.*

#### 'Every Force of Nature'
*So, ev'ry force of nature show'd  
the shatter'd ways the crystal glow'd.*

*A gemstone fit to lose our minds,  
that let us know such things remote;  
the broken ways the aura binds  
the empty days that time had wrote.*

*This world was made to counter-plot,  
now earthâ€™s inventions wait to rot.*

*In tangled vines the world calls out,  
through all the cracks it promptly got  
from days or years as shards about,  
and now all order earth forgot.*

*And ev'ry force of nature show'd  
the shatter'd ways the crystal glow'd.*
