## Characters
### Blueberry
Blueberry is a Demi-Slug. He was ostracised from his home in the 1st Realm for committing a crime, and was thrown into a magic pit. Magic is less prevalent in the -1st realm, so it was a major culture shock for magic to be so commonplace in the 2nd Realm, which added to his want to flee.
#### Motivations:
- He wants to find a place to settle down, but he is convinced there is little to no places that suit him
- So he wants to rid the world of magic and evil.
### Toadstool
Toadstool is a Minikin. He became a bandit as he was maturing, which led to an impressionable cousin of his joining as well and getting indirectly killed while on the job. After this, his family began to hate him, so he tries to prove himself as a good person at every opportunity.
#### Motivations:
- He wants to prove himself to his family that he's a good person and not a murderer,
- and he wants to rid the world of evil so that what happened to his cousin can never happen again.
### Riverbell
Riverbell is a Minikin. She is the daughter of Mossrot, who murdered his wife, her mother, and disappeared. Mossrot led the settlement of Lichenia, which meant that the leadership position was thrust upon her. Due to this trauma, she constantly tries to protect her village.
#### Motivations:
- She wants to protect her city at all costs,
- And she wants to rid the world of evil so that what happened to her parents could never happen to another person.
### Petrified Child
The Petrified Child is a [geode god](phenomena/geode-god.md). It was created with the objective to rid the world of evil, but no one knows if the petrified child truly follows the objective morality of the world. With the mind of a baby, its decision making may be skewed.

It was imprisoned by the Empire of the Petrified Child in their great temple, meaning that it couldn't save them when they fell, and got trapped forever.

It telepathically speaks in short sentences, always getting to the point, and often lies to reach the easiest conclusion. It is capable of saying different things to different people in the same moment. Its voice is like stones scraping.
#### Motivations:
- To rid the world of evil.
- To be let out.
### Mossrot
Mossrot, Riverbell's father, is a Minikin. He \[INSERT SOURCE OF HIS MOTIVATION HERE\] and became convinced he had to leave normal society and live without magic, removing his [fortuitary gland](phenomena/fortuitary-gland.md). Amassing a cult of followers, he fled with them to the 0th Realm and founded the city of Lichenia.

When he became old, he became convinced that magic was the only way to ensure his continued existence. Not only is this true as magic extends one's lifetime, but he also felt as if Riverbell was not ready to be a leader.

He murdered his wife, Riverblossom, for her fortuitary gland - and underwent partial [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md) once he came in contact with its magic after being kept from it for so long. He was transported to the -3rd realm, the most unstable, and became dangerous and insane.
#### Motivations:
- To flee a world of magic
- To live longer for Riverbell, if not forever for his own gain.
## Story
### Act 1
#### Chapter 1
Chapter 1 focuses on [Blueberry](characters/blueberry.md), and begins with him finding himself abandoned in the wilderness of the 0th Realm. He doesn't know how he got there, but he knows who he is - and that he can't return to his home.

He gets upset, but is calmed when he meets a Minikin called [Toadstool](characters/toadstool.md). Toadstool is a bandit, but tries to hide it out of embarrassment and fear, being cryptic. During their introduction, Blueberry tries to eat a berry Toadstool had as a snack, which is what he gets named after by Toadstool when he cannot pronounce his birth name.

After their introduction, the duo subsequently begin to fly over a lake. In the air, Blueberry opens up about what happened, and Toadstool resolves to take him in and give him the home he lacks. When they land, Toadstool creates a gateway to the 2nd Realm, and the two arrive at Amanitaville.

#### Chapter 2
Chapter 2 focusses on Toadstool, and begins with him and Blueberry arriving at the 2nd Realm, at Amanitaville, his hometown. The city is large, vertical, arboreal, and overwhelming. Toadstool tried to comfort Blueberry but is met with apprehension.

Many people stare at the two, the reader doesn't know why, but this is due to Toadstool's reputation. The two walk past a preacher talking about Lichenia, but ignore it. They move onward toward Toadstool's home tree.

At Toadstool's home tree, the family is gathering around the branches, eating their dinner. Toadstool is continually trying to push the impression that he's a good person and saved this demi-slug, but the family see it for what it is - 'You're only filling the void in mouths to feed after we lost \[Cousin\]'

The conversation at dinner is ripe with tension, and culminates in an all out argument, where Toadstool's backstory is revealed. Blueberry leaves the blueberry he was eating on the tree, and slips away.

Returning to the preacher, Blueberry enquires about the city, and decides to flee there. The chapter ends with Toadstool watching Blueberry as he is given a map to Lichenia and walks through a gateway the preacher had made and enters the 0th Realm forest to find the city.
