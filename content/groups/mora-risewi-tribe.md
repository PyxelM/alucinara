## Overview
The Móra riSéwi minikin ([Old Morellic](lore/languages/old-morellic.md): 'Children of Mora,' Móra riSéwi < `*moza li-sevi`) were a nomadic tribe from around the time of [Naíru](locations/2nd-realm/nairu.md).

Their name refers to the deity of the forest in the Morellic pantheon, an alternative translation could be 'Children of the Forest.'

Their cultural traditions and way of life was that of never settling down unless they were under extreme circumstances, continually moving from place to place in search of food, resources, and treasure.

They would set up campsites, generally in trees, but also in bushes for its strategic advantage in areas inhabited by territorial natives. They would sleep in natural dens in trees, but also set up hammocks made out of leaves and fabric.
### Communities
Móra riSéwi communities were made up of an extended family, this could range from 50 related individuals to 500 related individuals.

These communities would share food with eachother, share resources, all sleep in one camp together when night came, and would all work together to achieve their common goals as a group.
### Government
The government of Móra riSéwi communities was that of a matriarchy, as with a lot of minikin tribes. The oldest and wisest woman would be appointed to lead a group, and power would be divested matrilineally to her eldest daughter upon her death.

It was the matriarch's responsibility to keep order within her community, while also leading her group on expeditions for food, resources, or treasure.

When not actively moving, the matriarch would be teaching the children of the group good morals and how to survive effectvely, she would give her own eldest daughter special treatment due to her importance to the future of the group.
