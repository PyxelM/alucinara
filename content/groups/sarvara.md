## Overview
Sarvara was a [Morellic](groups/morellic*.md) [city](locations/sarvara-(city).md) and Bronze-Age civilisation located on the river Sarav, after which it was named, in the [Sarvaran River Basin](locations/sarvaran-river-basin*.md). The language of Sarvara was Classical Sarvaran, a Southern Morellic language. The civilisation traces it's origins to the [Mora](groups/mora.md), a neolithic tribe native to the southern Tseirephic steppes.

It was founded as the city of Sabelin by the [Diira](groups/diira*.md), the ruins of which were appropriated into the city it would later become. It would eventually become the most prominent and innovative power of contemporary [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md), before its collapse circa the year 2,000 of the Sarvaran calendar. 
## Societal Structure
The Sarvarans lived in semi-arboreal cities and villages led by noble matriarchs, who were given power and influence over certain regions by their suzerains. The society was led by the High Matriarch, who held the monarchal, hereditary role of power over the whole of Sarvaran civilisation.
### Religion
The religion of Sarvara was largely monotheistic, centred around the deity of the [Petrified Child](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md). However, the [Angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) were also venerated, and often called upon in times of need. The nobles of Sarvara often held priestly roles, with power centralised in the temples.
### Gender Roles
Women held an almost sacred role in Sarvaran society, with adult women required to shave their heads and perform ritual ablutions twice a day; women performed the roles of spiritual leaders, weavers, and artists. Men were often farmers and labourers, letting their long hair down or tied into buns. Both male and female Sarvaran nobles could dedicate themselves to science and innovation for the sake of their society.
### Caste System
The Caste system of Sarvara was characterised by vast inequality. Women were seen above men, and the society was led by a ruling caste of matriarchs and priestly nobles, with the soldiers, commoners, and outcasts below. It was taboo to mix these castes by marriage or proximity.
## Clothing
Sarvarans often wore woven clothing made of [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) linen and [Yurikh](fauna/yurikhs.md) leather. Women and men wore thigh-length tunics with leather belts and bell-shaped sleeves, with puffy trousers resembling shorts or breeches, and a thick coat worn over the tunic made of fur or cotton. Leather shoes were also common.
## Language
[Classical Sarvaran](languages/classical-sarvaran.md) is the polysynthetic, head marking, SOV language of the Sarvaran [minikin](fauna/minikin.md). It has noun incorporation and lacks cases and the definite article, but has an extensive lexicon of prepositions, persons, aspects, and moods.
## Calendar
The Sarvaran calendar is a lunisolar calendar, following the cycle of the moon 'Ena' around the sun 'Cadra'. It is made up of 8 months, which are made up of 4 weeks of 8 days, with three days of rest and worship at the end of every week. ThSarvarae years are counted from the birth of the Sarvaran prophet [Cira](characters/cira.md), a [Moraic](groups/mora.md) matriarch who performed miracles for the benefit of her people with the aid of the [Angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md).
