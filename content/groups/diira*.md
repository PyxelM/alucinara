## Overview
The Diira were a late neolithic tribe of semi-nomadic [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) native to the mediterranean regions of southern [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md) in the [2nd realm](locations/2nd-realm*.md), belonging to the [Nethic](groups/nethic.md) culture. They had light brown skin and lacked much hair, with an eye colour of hazel. They lived in matriarchal communities and spoke a language reconstructed as [Proto-Nethic](languages/proto-nethic.md).
## Societal Structure
The Diira lived in familial, migratory comunities led by a matriarchal elder woman who would command, judge, represent, and aid the group in survival and diplomacy. Eunuch shamans would also lead each group in worship, following a form of polytheistic animism.

## Lifestyle
The Diira were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, travelling and settling in and across the various areas of southern Tseireph. They lived in huts made of sticks and animal hide, where the families would sleep and rest, and would settle in an area if it proved to have an advantageous amount of food, such as fruit, vegetables, cereals, and small prey animals.
### Proto-Farming
Some Diiran groups would settle in a certain area, find a good amount of plants, and leave not once they had exhausted the area; rather they would leave some left, so the ecosystem could regrow. This developed into a form of proto-farming that eventually involved the spreading of seeds, annual harvests, and agriculture. This practice would go on to influence many Bronze-Age agricultural civilisations such as [Neth](groups/neth.md) and [Sarvara](groups/sarvara.md).
