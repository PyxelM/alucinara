## Overview
The Mora were a late neolithic tribe of pastoralist-nomadic [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) native to the steppes of [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md) in the [2nd realm](locations/2nd-realm*.md), belonging to the [Morellic](groups/morellic*.md) culture. They had brown skin and were largely hairless with an eye colour ranging from emerald to hazel, lived in matriarchal communities, and spoke a language reconstructed as [Proto-Morellic](languages/proto-morellic.md).
## Societal Structure
The Mora lived in matriarchal communities, led by the matriarch - an elder woman who had usually proven herself in battle or a similar great feat, and been chosen by the consensus of her group. These communities were largely familial, with males leaving at maturity to marry into other communities.
### Gender Roles
Women were seen as an almost sacred class, the givers of life and nurturers of children, who conducted diplomacy, dedicated themselves to religion and theosophy, and wove fabric; whereas men were seen as a more vulgar class, who oversaw the practices of animal husbandry and hard labour.

A third, neuter class of eunuchs existed also, which was rare but not unheard of. Moric eunuchs may have been intersex, nonbinary, or unable to go through puberty. They were seen to be able to bridge the gap between the male and female roles, serving as religious leaders, but not matriarchs, and herders, but not hard labourers.
## Lifestyle
The Mora were nomadic pastoralists of the steppe, traversing the grasslands with their herd. They mostly kept animals such as [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md) and [yurikhs](fauna/yurikhs.md), and hunted other animals such as [pringis](fauna/pringis.md) and [treemice](fauna/treemice.md), using their skill as adept dartsmen.
## Clothing and Appearance
The Mora generally wore clothes made of plant fiber (such as wild [lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) linen) and yurikh hide, wearing long, dress-like tunics of fabric, leather belts, and overcoats. The males would let their hair down into a jaw to shoulder length style, or tie it up into a bun, and females would shave their head bald as part of a cultural tradition.
