`Al`ucinarium, also referred to as *Alu'*, is a crystalline metallic element and the source of all alucinara magic. It can generate thermal energy, kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, light, and many more unknown phenomena - all with minimal to no input.

## Colour
The colour of Alucinarium is debated, as it changes in hue when executing different forms of Alucinara Magic. It is commonly observed as being purple or pink, as this is the colour it takes when inactive.

## Uses
Alucinarium is used by many organisms for many reasons. Some plant and animal species have evolved to use it in order to stun predators with a bright flash of light when disturbed, and some [infra-essent](alucinara/realms/infra-essence.md) entities have evolved to use it in order to pull prey into their grasp by altering gravitational energy.
