Alucinarium, `Al`, is an element and the source of all alucinara magic. It can generate thermal energy, kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, light, and many more unknown phenomena - all with minimal to no input.

# Uses
Alucinarium is used by many organisms for many reasons. Some plant and animal species have evolved to use it in order to stun predators with a bright flash of light when disturbed, and some [infra-essent](realms/infra-essence.md) entities have evolved to use it in order to pull prey into their grasp by altering gravitational energy.
