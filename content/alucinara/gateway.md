Alucinara Gateways are used by Realm-Hoppers in order to travel between realms, although most people do not due to the danger of an unfamiliar world - Realm Hoppers often tend to be miners, scientists and bandits.

# Creation
Alucinara Gateways are often created by depositing Alucinarium onto a location, whence a gateways will form as a purple, sparkling, swirling portal, often the size of a [Minikin](fauna/minikin/minikin.md) - although the size can vary depending on the amount used.
