## Creation
At first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The material of the void was Darkness, a pitch-black substance made of hydrocarbons. There were two consciousnesses in the void, the first Judge and the second, who existed to create the universe.

The first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they cleared the void of darkness, designed planets, stars, elements, and each their roles in the universe.

Stars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a fast steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which predestined the universe to appear as an art piece. Beautiful, ornamental, and not meant for living inhabitants.

### Life
However, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of their own; *life*. Life was created in the form of the Darklings - creatures made of darkness, hidden from light so that they would not be discovered.

The darklings immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the natural laws not built for them. They built empires founded on the backs of planets, and sucked the light out of stars for energy, so that the darkness could spread, and so that they could continue to go undiscovered.

### Darklings' Mistake
Eventually, the darklings grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the first judge once the last star was gone. The first judge was furious when it had discovered them, disgusted and mortified that matter could move and take reality for its own interests, never to aid nature.

In an apocalyptic turn of events, the first judge shattered the walls of reality as it tried in vain to push off the darklings, and it was unfortunately subsumed by the mass of living darkness.

## Aftermath
Almost immediately, the second judge created the [second laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a last-ditch attempt to save its companion, but it was too late, and only served to worsen the shattered new reality. In the first judge's last moments, it turned itself [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), an infinite form of energy that would allow the first laws to live on within the second laws, allowing its legacy to continue.

### The Darklings
It also banished the darklings to the void-space that surrounded every small bubble of reality left. It defined their place in the universe, that they would never be able to destroy the world unfettered once more. Without alucinara energy, that would bring the first laws of nature back into effect, the darklings would be rendered a simple tar - with no thoughts and no intentions, a product of the second laws.

The first judge resolved to turn their existence into some good - it had created the *soul*.

### The Soul
The Darklings were then turned into Souls, which are Darkness under effects of Alucinara. It was created so that the darklings could only touch reality by fuelling the good of an innocent creature, and could never do anything without the limits of a biochemical host.

The soul could only manifest as amino acids, or other organic compounds such as tar, when in contact with alucinara. This is what gives organisms such as animals and plants life - the amino acids in their bodies interacts with aluicnara to create thought and intention.

Without alucinara, darklings would only appear as organic compounds *without* the capacity for thought, as the second laws of nature weren't built to perpetuate the soul. They often appear as the natural substance tar, being given their own place in the universe such as in tar pits and resin.

### The Realms
In the universe's final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more succeptible to the effects of the [first laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md).

One could shift from realm to realm by creating [alucinara gateways](phenomena/alucinara-gateway), the process getting more alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.

## Heirarchy of Beings
In the new realms, things began to settle. The threat of further shattering decreased to zero, and stars began to flare once more into eternal brightness. New things began to be created, as well, things that were impossible under the old laws.

### Planets
For example, planets formed into largely static mounds of dust and minerals. Given enough tar were present in one, and given enough alucinara energy was nearby, a soul could be formed within. One such soul was [Qerhel](deities/qerhel.md), who resided within the planet of the same name, within the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md).

### Mountains and Oceans
In addition, a soul could divide and its new children could take a smaller, more specified, element of their parent as a host. The two elements that a child could take a hold of were the land and sea, each child soul residing within one or more mountains or oceans.

### Biomes
Further division could occur, and the ways for a soul to manifest became larger. An ocean soul could divide into a coral reef, an abyss, or a kelp forest. Likewise, a mountain soul could divide into a land forest, a desert, or another biome. In some cases, a mountain soul could even divide into a creature capable of movement.

### Higher-Order Creatures
For example, a creature formed from a mountain is [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), which is made of a large, floating, alucinarium geode. It is externally visible as a rock with the face of a child, and became revered as a deity in many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.

Creatures formed from mountains are known as higher-order creatures, to distinguish them from lower-order creatures such as animals and nonliving phenomena such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md).

### Lower-Order Creatures
Lower order creatures, formed from the biomes, are animals such as ruminants, birds, reptiles, or minikin, et cetera. They are the most common of the souls, as they are able to create new physical bodies with the process of reproduction; this is a very effective stategy, due to the short lifespans of their physical bodies and likelyhood of disability compared to other souls.

Some lower-order creatures can live for very long, however, especially when aided with the help of alucinara energy. Some even make use of alucinara with help of the fortuitary gland, although this is rare in the 0th and nearby realms.

Humans are the most common creature in the 0th realm, [Demi-Slugs](species/fauna/demi-slugs.md) the most common in the 1st, [Dragons](species/fauna/dragons.md) the most common in the -1st, [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) the most common in the 2nd, [Quartz Mice](species/fauna/quartz-mice.md) the most common in the -2nd, [Botanists](species/flora/botanists.md) the most common in the 3rd, and [Wormwolves](species/fauna/wormwolves.md) the most common in the -3rd.

### Nonliving Phenomena
Nonliving phenomena are the result of alucinara interacting with matter without the presence of a soul. When alucinara is used in a soul, the patterns that come with being an animal are drilled into the energy like muscle memory, leading to the [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle).

When alucinara interacts with nonliving matter with the principle in effect, it will cause the matter to act as if it were an animal, attempting to fight, eat, and drink, all with no benefit. Some nonliving phenomena are commonplace, such as [cloud gnats](phenomena/cloud-gnats.md), [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md), or [sky islands](phenomena/sky-islands.md).

## Species of the Realms
In every realm, many many species had developed. The specieses of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with alucinara energy. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.

### The Supernova of 80MB
In 80MB[^1], the shockwave of a far-off supernova had finally reached the Earth. The star that had caused it was extremely old, having retained a lot of alucinara from the energy left over from the shattering of the realms.

There was virtually no destruction on that day, but the main outcome was mass-frequencial shift of the animals and plants affected. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into different realms. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.

## The History of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md)
### The Hollow Tree
One day in the early autumn, a [Móra riSéwi](groups/mora-risewi-tribe.md) group was exploring the northern wilderness of the [central continent](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent.md). As they reached the edge of a steppe, they found a forest.

Foraging for food in the forest as they as their ancestors had done for hundreds of years, they went further deep, eventually stumbling upon a clearing, which had a circular swamp with a tree in the centre.

The swamp and tree looked normal from afar, but upon closer inspection it was noticed that the swamp not only was filled with tar, but also that the tree was grey, with a grey ridged surface. 

When the minikin attempted to climb the tree, it was promptly discovered that the tree was flimsy, hollow, and broke into pieces under the slightest touch, solid black fumes pouring out of the hole before evaporating into oblivion.

The pieces that had broken off of the tree, however, lacked gravity, and soon floated back into their original positions, and the fumes ceased to pour out.
### The Golden Fruit
As the minikin touched the tree more and more, watching it break like dust into black clouds before reforming, they noticed that there was a great lot of fruit at the bottom of the hollow trunk, and the fruit was gold.

The fruit kept the consistency of real fruit, but appeared shiny and golden, and their insides were wet, fleshy, and white, with a pitch-black stone in the centre.

The group's leader, a minikin known as [Grasscap](characters/grasscap.md), took the initiative to eat the fruit, but immediately she began to cough, violently hacking up the same solid back fumes of the tree. What the group didn't know nor understand, was that she had contracted the [Curse of Hollowness](phenomena/curses/hollowness.md).

The group immediately tried to place the golden fruit back, but in the blink of an eye the entire swamp, the fruit, and the tree had dissapeared without them noticing.

Frightened and confused by what had happened, the group decided to return to foraging, but the air was bitter and the entire group was afraid. Grasscap attempted to be confident however, and never truly let herself resign to fear.
### The Plague
While a lot of the group were convinced the event was an apparition that never truly existed or threatened anyone, it soon showed that Grasscap would continually and routinely begin coughing more and more of the black fumes, and her state worsened over time.

The spiritual leaders of the group settled that the event was a Nightmare coming to life and affecting the real world, and while the world may have woken up, Carsai was affected still from eating the fruit.

A lot of the minikin were scared to be around her for fear of breathing in the fumes once others began to show the same symptoms, and eventually portions her own body began to turn to the same gravityless mass of the tree.
### Flight to Naíru
It was soon that these Móra riSéwi minikin decided to move to [Naíru](locations/2nd-realm/nairu.md), to settle down and maybe find a cure for their afflicted, on account of the advanced medicinal industry of the city-state.

Grasscap proved herself bedridden, laying in a hospital den indefinitely, but she was in good spirits and continued to attempt to guide her group with her wisdom and advice.

A lot of the group joined the effort to bring a halt to the plague, creating potions, blessing certain mixtures, and creating face-masks to block the black fumes from getting from and to others.
### Death of Many
Despite the great effort of a lot of minikin, the first people began to die. Mostly poor Naíruans, but eventually, the nobles and royalty.

Cloudwind, twin sister of the co-regnant Moonwind, was one of those to die. The two deformed twins ruled the city of Naíru at the time, and shared one [soul](phenomena/darkness.md) enough for two people due to their twinhood.

This meant that Moonwind took a massive blow upon the death of her sister. Not only was her city crumbling, but her sister was also gone, and she was being filled to overflowing with [Darkness]().

Showing the signs of [phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md), she began to go insane on top of the stress she was under. Blaming Grasscap and the Móra riSéwi minikin as a whole, she ordered they be executed, especially Grasscap.

Grasscap had not died yet due to her own resilience as a person, but also due to the Móra riSéwi's spiritualism, which gave them the knowledge of how to [charm](phenomena/enchantment.md) their healths.

### Execution of Grasscap
Moonwind took it into her own hands to exact judgement upon Grasscap, blaming her specifically for her sister's death.

With purple [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) crystals growing upon her skin and orange orb-sparks flaring at every movement, she stood before the emaciated Grasscap.

The Móra riSéwi leader opened her mouth dryly to convey an ancient poem about the nature of the universe, in an attempt to enlighten Moonwind, but it was of no use.

Upon the first word of the poem, Moonwind hacked Grasscap to pieces in her den. A ghastly mixture of red mist, blood, and black fumes filled the air, with the deathly sound of darkness shreiking out as her soul left her body.
### The Petrified Child Saw
As with many other charming methods, one mechanism employed by the Móra riSéwi minikin was the use of [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md). Thus, the petrified child saw the whole thing.

The Oyhólıru were orders of magnitude less spiritual, or at least less spiritual in the more correct manner, as the Móra riSéwi's spiritual practices and philosophies aligned greatly with the phenomena and truths of the universe.

This meant that not only did the Oyhólıru not have the experience to treat reality the 'right' way, but they were also way out of their depth when interacting with more spiritual groups, leading to mistakes such as the one Moonwind made.
### Moonwind Defeated by the Petrified Child
The Petrified Child, having been notified of the evil act by the watchstones peppered about the trees and dens of the Móra riSéwi, immediately made a beeline for the city.

Reaching the royal tree, matching it in size in comparison to the miniscule minikin, it stared on wonderously at Moonwind. Moonwind was terrified of it, and pleaded with it not to hurt her or her kingdom, that they had experienced enough tragedy yet, but it was of no use, and the petrified child blinked at her with the sound of crackling rocks and spoke, in an angelic somber voice, 'I don't like you.'

Moonwind's face turned from a diplomatic smile to a fearful frown, and in one moment she called for her servants and guards to attack the Petrified Child, to make sure it wouldn't kill her, but the child was made of stone. Any weaponry available to the Naíruans was futile, and their spears cumpled and bounced off of the child's surface.

The last thing that Moonwind ever saw and heard was the sorrowful face of the god, crying and screeching with echoes bouncing off of mountains a continent away. And then she was gone, along with her guards, her servants, her kingdom, her sister, and her adversary Grasscap, only in that royal tree was left the Petrified Child.
### The Naíruan Baby Meadow
In an instant, the government and all structure in the city was lost, in what *was* great royal tree of wonder and order, was now a simple plant. A plant now with the most luscious flora growing upon its branches, and now with the most strengthened pathogens to grace the universe.

The entire Oyhólıru populus had no idea what a baby meadow was, all they knew was that in the blink of an eye a massive swaddled baby made out of stone had turned their beloved queen into nothing but a beautiful meadow in the midst of her tree.

Naturally, everybody began screaming, looting, fighting, and running. They didn't know what to do and were terrified of what had happened, the Petrified Child had disappeared in a blink to all in the crowd.
### The Móra riSéwi Flee
The Móra riSéwi, seeing all of this, knew what was wrong. They had heard tales of Baby Meadows, but had only seen their aftermaths and the great mounds of bones at their core, never up close as they were created.

As much as the sight was beautiful, Grasscap's daughter, Grassapple, who was now in charge, promptly made the entire group snap out of their focus on the morbid event. Her first command was to make leave for the shore and leave behind all sick, to escape the area's chaos and the curse of hollowness.

Their first destination was the [Natswh'kara river](locations/2nd-realm/natswh'kara-river.md), as they knew that if they followed it downstream, they could reach the sea very quickly, (Naíru was built close to the shore and was a port city) and they could use the inland flora to construct boats and rafts out of sticks and vegetation very effectively.

Soon, they went downstream upon their rafts, leaving behind all sick from the curse of hollowness. after a short period, they reached the mouth of the river, and brought out large sticks and leaves to serve as oars.

### The Journey across the Sarvaran Gulf
The Móra riSéwi resolved to get as far away as they could. They had no obligation to stay in Naíru once Grasscap was dead and the mourning period was over by the time the Petrified Child arrived.

All Naíru was to the Móra riSéwi was a broken city with no relevance anymore, and the group figured there would be little detriment to feeling to a new land; they were people of the forest, they could fend for themselves - all they had to do was explore, find where the food was, and charm it for preservation.

They agreed to journey to the South-West, collectively sailing as a fleet to their shared destination. They would throw overboard and minikin showing signs of the curse of hollowness, and ration what food they had left. After 2 months when the journey was over, all who died from starvation or dehydration or were sick were left behind at the bottom of the ocean.
### The Group Reaches the South-West Shore
Once the Móra riSéwi minikin had reached the shore, they immediately leaped off of their boats and rafts and ran in search of food toward the forests and stepped of the wilderness.

The first major landmark which the minikin found was the [Abhmýra](lore/locations/2nd-realm/abhmyra-river.md), a river in the midst of a lush valley, which the group promptly took for themselves. The starving minikin would rip up and eat anything they could find, eating leaves, grass, bark, and so on, as they had absolutely no idea where the nutritious edible food was.
### The Kaśtaira Help
In fact, the Móra riSéwi's emaciated bodies looked little better than when they had arrived, even after a couple years. And the natives, looking upon the poor desparate group, took pity on them.

The group that had noticed the Móra riSéwi was the [Western Kaśtaira](lore/groups/western-kastaira-tribe.md), a [Śuténqan](lore/groups/sutenqan-tribe.md) group, distinct from the related [Eastern Kaśtaira](lore/groups/eastern-kastaira-tribe.md) and the [ó Źol](lore/groups/ozol-tribe.md). They took pity on the Móra riSéwi, taking them in, feeding them, and giving them a place to recover from the sustained malnutrition they had suffered since setting off from Naíru.
#### The Kaśtaira's Conditions
After the Móra riSéwi had seen the Kaśtaira's hospitality, the Kaśtaira matriarchs all came together to discuss the situation; the Móra riSéwi were surely another set of mouths to feed, another group leeching the land of resources.

In a compromise, the matriarchs decided that the Móra riSéwi would be permitted to live in their settlements as long as they be driven out once they knew how to fend for themselves in their new habitat.

### The Móra riSéwi Settle
After the matriarchs' decision, the Móra riSéwi all felt more and more comfortable dwelling in their settlements; Naíru had proved to get them used to cities and the culture-shock in living with non-nomads. In fact, the Móra riSéwi felt so comfortable that they naturally began to find love in their new environment, settling down with the Kaśtairan natives in marriage.

The Móra riSéwi didn't need to learn how to build their own settlements by being taught, but they rather married into a tribe that did, and the next generation inhereted the knowledge from their native parent and their culture as they were raised.

As time went on, the need for the Móra riSéwi minikin to leave became obsolete; a fair amount of Móra riSéwi minikin were now (partially) native Western Kaśtaira. But this didn't nullify the agreement the matriarchs had made, their declaration was 'signed in blood', meaning they couldn't backtrack on their decision.
### The Móra riSéwi Depart
Upon the next meeting of the matriarchs concerning the The Móra riSéwi, they agreed it was time that they had better leave. However, most Móra riSéwi minikin living in their settlements had a 50% claim to staying, which made the agreement largely redundant.

The matriarchs still demand that the Móra riSéwi leave, pointing out the agreement which was painted into wooden tablets in red dye. And the Móra riSéwi agreed, they ought to leave, despite their claim to the area. A lot of fuly native people left as well, as parents of mixed-Móra riSéwi children.

The Móra riSéwi minikin's main reason for leaving was the fact that they wished to preserve their culture; they didn't dislike Kaśtaira culture, in fact, they incorporated a lot of it into their own, but rather they didn't wish to be completely subsumed.

The place the Móra riSéwi knew they had to settle was clear, the Abhmýra river valley, which was semi-mythologised as tales that the settlers had told their children in the story of how they got to where they were.

And after a trek of about a week, the entire tribe had reached the river valley, as green and beautiful (if not more) as when the Móra riSéwi had arrived. The valley featured the titular river, but it also proved evident that there was an island int eh centre of the river, an eyot with a large tree in the middle.

Standing upon the top of the surrounding hills, Grassquartz the queen, daughter of Grassapple, daughter of Grasscap, leaned over to her second in command and, pointing to the tree, said 'This is where we will live.'
### Founding of Sarvara
Grassquartz ordered the building of the city immediately, and so the people went to build. They termed the city [Sarvara](locations/2nd-realm/sarvara.md), meaning 'Our Valley,' and stayed there, having lost their nomadic tradition for the Kaśtaira tradition of settling down.
#### Morellic; the Sarvaran Ethnicity
This Móra riSéwi group, having genetically and culturally merged with the Kaśtaira, began to find it harder and harder to consider themselves Móra riSéwi.  

A lot of the partially native children found it alienating to align themselves with a group from a sea away who looked different to them (Or, like *only* one of their parents.) So, a compromise was reached, and the Móra riSéwi eventually became the [Morellic](lore/groups/morellic-tribe.md) minikin - a new, separate group entirely.
#### Sarvaran Construction
Taking a page out of their Kaśtaira ancestry, they built their dens out of clay, collecting mud from the riverbed and carrying it up to the canopy in their cheek pouches.

In addition, they also packed clay onto the upper sides of the branches to create walkways, they built staircases and ramps spiraling up the treetrunks for the verticality of the city, and built [levitation-charmed](phenomena/enchantment/levitation.md) stepping stones and clay bridges to connect each tree to one another other.
