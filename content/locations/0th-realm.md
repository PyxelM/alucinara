## Names
The name of this realm was derived from **Basii** + **Adrani**, **Basii** being from Arabic [**بَشَر**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1#Arabic), which came into Proto-Morellic (through contact with 0°e peoples) as **Basiar**, "human." **Basii** is the adjectival form, so **Basii Adrani** means "Human Realm."

Proto-Morellic: *Basii Adrani* `/ˈbä.ʃi ädˈrä.ni/`

Sarvaran: *Bázha Edrą́da* `/ˈbá.ʒa eˈdɾã́.da/`

Stonechild Imperial: *Vásh Ját* `/ˈváʃ ˈd̠͡ʒát/`
