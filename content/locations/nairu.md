## Overview
N치iru was an ancient city in the 2nd realm, and the capitol of the [Oyh칩yunol Empire](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md).

## Societal Structure
N치iru, one of the first city-states, developed a caste system with 4 levels;
- The highest level, the royals;
- The second highest level, the nobles;
- The second lowest level, the farmers;
- And the lowest level, the soulless.

### Royals
The royals relied wholly upon their servants, typically nobles, for food and riches. Taxes and tithes of the harvest were taken from the farmers by the nobles and given to the royals to supply them with rare gems, shiny metals, and large portions of crops and food.

Otherwise, they would be trained from a young age to be very battle-smart; their brains would dabble little in trivial things, and would play board games with their fellow royals or nobles when not actively deciding what strategies to take in war, lawmaking, and diplomacy.
