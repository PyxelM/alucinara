### Sarvaran Region
The sarvaran region was one of the first settled regions in the central continent. Being next to the Keimodhaw lake, taking advantage the many rivers and smaller lakes nearby, the [Sarvaran Culture](cultures/morellic/sarvara/sarvara.md) was able to grow to become one of the earliest and most advanced civilisations of the time.
