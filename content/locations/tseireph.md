### Mountain Ranges
#### Jana Mountains
The mountains of Jana are a major mountain range at Tseireph's southern border. They form the northern edge of the [Sarvaran river basin](locations/sarvaran-river-basin*.md) and contain many deposits of metal such as copper, iron, and gold. Their ferrous and cupreous composition made them a vital part of the creation of metal (especially bronze) tools and of the rise of the [Sarvaran](factions/sarvara.md) empire.
