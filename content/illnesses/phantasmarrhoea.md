## Overview
Phantasmarrhoea (**Sarvaran**: *Fantasmeyolh* ) is a physiological condition that affects living beings. It causes those affected, known as Phantasms, to experience irreversable physical and mental effects, leading to the growth of Alucinarium on the body and psychosis.
## Contraction
Phantasmarrhoea is contracted through exposure to more [Alucinara energy](cosmology/alucinara.md) than the body can handle, varying depending on the levels of exposure and one's immunity to the adverse effects of Alucinara.
## Symptoms
The many symptoms of Phantasmarrhoea are marked by:
- The accumulation of Alucinarium in the body and on the skin
- Infertility
- Hair loss, or Alopecia
- Hallucinations
- Psychosis, paranoia, and violent, antisocial behaviour 
- Pale, purple skin and eyes
- Skin irritation, rashes, and pain
- Blindness
- Essential Shift into the infra-essent realms.
## Appearance
Phantasms' appearance is defined by harsh crystals growing all across their bodies, originating at the hands, feet, and tail. Furthermore, any exposed skin is generally pink, translucent, and pale, with blood vessels visible from beneath the surface, and their eyes are often pale, with a pink tint. They are often accompanied by orbs and sparks of light, through which they see, once blindness has set into the eyes.
## Behaviour
Phantasms are deeply violent toward other living beings, using the razor-sharp Alucinarium crystals that grow upon their body to scratch and attack others. In addition, their violent behaviour leads them to live solitary, lonely lives in the infra-essent realms.
