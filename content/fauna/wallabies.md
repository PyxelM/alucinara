## Overview
Wallabies are a species of marsupials native to the 1st and [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) realms. They are diurnal herbivores descended from the Dwarf Wallabies of the 0th realm, consuming wild grasses, leaves, and vegetables. They inhabit the semi-arid regions, the deserts and steppes, of the eastern continent and northern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md).
## Appearance
Wallabies can reach a length of 45 cm from snout to tial at maturity. They have two large, bulky legs which they use to hop around, a thick, sturdy tail, and two short arms with sharp claws. Their fur is generally short and brown to white in colour to blend into their habitats.
## Behaviour
Wallabies are violent and mate for life. Males often fight one another to assert dominance and impress females, using their powerful legs and sharp claws in battle. Furthermore, [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) use is shown in some individuals who utilise the energy to hurl stones at aggressors.
## Predators
Wallabies are naturally hunted by [wildcats](fauna/wildcats.md) and sometimes by large packs of [wolfrats](fauna/wolfrats.md) and groups of [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), especially by hunter-gatherers targetting infant wallabies.
