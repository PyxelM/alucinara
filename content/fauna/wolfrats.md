## Overview
Wolfrats are a species of carnivorous rodents native to the -1st and -3rd realms. They are predators descended from Grasshopper Mice, but are larger and bulkier. They are nocturnal and inhabit the steppes and plains of their homes, feeding on small animals.
## Appearance
Wolfrats are roughly 30cm tall at the shoulder in maturity, with muscular bodies. They feature sharp claws, four continuously-growing canine fangs, a sensitive, wet nose, two pointed ears, and large, forward-facing eyes which allow the wolfrat to see well in the dark. They are covered with a thin layer of dark fur across their whole body, with many long whiskers.
## Behaviour
Wolfrats tend to travel in small hunting packs, avoid bright lights such as from the sun, and have been known to use [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) energy to cook raw meat before consumption, create strange noises to confuse and stun their prey, and hurl objects at larger predators that wish to harm their litter.
## Diet
Wolfrats are carnivores, mainly consuming animals such as insects, larvae, small mammals, amphibians, and snakes, and their eggs.
