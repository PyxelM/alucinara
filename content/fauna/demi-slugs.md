## Overview
Demi-Slugs are a species of hermaphroditic gastropod mollusks native to the 1st realm. They are terrestrial, semi-anthropoid herbivores descended from the Great Grey Slug. They are the most populous and intelligent race of the 1st realm, and are capable of their own distinct form of speech, agriculture, [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) use, and civilisation.
## Appearance
Demi-Slugs are 20cm tall at maturity, from their foot to their head. They feature 2 pneumostomes at the base of their neck, a mollusk foot, and 4 tentacle-like arms. They have smooth, wet, grey-brown skin with black spots, and are entirely hairless.
## Children
Demi-Slug children are miniscule, only about 1cm in length when they hatch from their eggs. They are fed a solution of specialised mucus from their parents, similar to milk in mammals, containing nutrients, protien, and glucose for the child to grow and thrive. Many demi-slug children perish young, so litters can reach up to 50 eggs in one spawning.
## Behaviour
Demi-Slugs are crepuscular, awake in the twilight of dusk and dawn, and only come out in humid or wet weather. They spend their time in semi-subterranean complexes, collecting mud in their mouths which they use to fortify walls and create structures above-ground.

They generally build these complexes in wetland climates or nearby water sources such as oases and springs. This allows them a humid climate where they are unlikely to dessicate and perish, and where they can easily hydrate themselves.
### Language
They utilise [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to generate tones and rhythms by telekinetically vibrating an organ within their bodies which they use to communicate, attenuating these tones with their pneumostomes. This allows them to communicate with species with different speech anatomy, such as [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), by replicating the sound of their speech.
## Diet
Demi-Slugs are herbivorous, consuming living and rotting plant matter such as leaves, vegetables, wood, fruit, and seeds. Some civilisations grind down and / or dehydrate food for later use, rehydrating them with nearby water sources.
