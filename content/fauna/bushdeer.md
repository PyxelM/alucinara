## Overview
Bushdeer are a genus of deer native to the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and -1st realms. They are herbivores descended from Sika deer, but feature kleptoplastic shrubbery on their antlers and skeleton-like fur patterns. They inhabit the plains and continental forests of [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md).
## Appearance
Bushdeer can vary in height according to species, from 30cm to 1m at the shoulder. They feature dark, brown fur, with green mossy patches, and a white fur pattern that mimics exposed bone, causing the bushdeer to appear rotten and inedible to predators. Their antlers are covered by kleptoplastic leaves, allowing the bushdeer not only to camouflage in the greenery, but also photosynthesise during periods of cessation.
## Species
Some species of Bushdeer are large and muscular, living on the ground, in plains, forests, and sometimes rocky habitats. In contrast, some species are smaller, such as the pygmy bushdeer, which is specialised for an arboreal lifestyle, blending in with the canopy.
## Behaviour
Bushdeer behaviour is defined by periods of hibernation and apparent death. Not only do they  hibernate in the winter as their metabolism slows down and they are sustained by photosynthesis, but they also play dead when threatened. They are kept safe by their markings that deter would-be predators.

Furthermore, male bushdeer are greatly territorial, using their sharp hooves and antlers to attack mating competition and other animals that trespass into the deer's territory. Females are likewise violent, protecting their young from predators and using [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to force them from harm's way.
## Hunting
Bushdeer are hunted by some [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) groups where their territories overlap; for example, pygmy bushdeer are an ideal prey animal due to the ease required to hunt them compared to bulkier species. Their 'leaves' are a delicacy in many Minikin cultures, being used in meals such as salads and stews alongside other meats and true leaves.
## Diet
Bushdeer have a herbivorous diet, consuming mainly leaves, weeds, flowers, and fruit. It is from their diet that they gain the chloroplasts needed to photosynthesise.
