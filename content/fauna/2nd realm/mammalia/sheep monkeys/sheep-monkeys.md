Sheep Monkeys are small mammals, related to earth goats (*Capra aegagrus*). They resemble Caprines, hence their name.

## Biology
### Habitat
Unlike [0th Realm](locations/0th-realm.md) Caprines, Sheep Monkeys live in trees.

### Morphology
#### Fur
Sheep Monkeys have medium-to-short fluffy fur, which is harvested by [Minikin](fauna/2nd%20realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md).

##### Colour
The colour of Sheep Monkey fur varies from brown to white, depending on the season or species.

Usually, their fur is brown in the summer as to blend in with wood, ginger in the autumn to blend in with red and orange leaves, and white in the winter in order to blend in with the snow that caps their homes.

#### Limbs
Sheep Monkey Limbs vary from [0th Realm](locations/0th-realm.md) animals, as is usual in realms other than it.

They feature 6 limbs, all used for locomotion. However, their front 2 limbs are more specialised for climbing, having 2 forward-facing fingers capped with small yet sharp hoof-like fingernails, and a thumb on the other side of the palm which mutated from the ball of their foot.

They use their front 2 limbs in order to climb and grab fruit as well as other food items.

##### Tool use
Rarely, Sheep Monkeys exhibit tool use, in that they throw sticks or rocks at food items they cannot reach, in an attempt to knock them loose.

#### Eyes
Sheep Monkeys have large eyes on the sides of their heads, an adaptation effective in allowing them not only to see well in the night but also to notice predators such as birds coming nearby.

#### Tail
Sheep Monkeys have long fluffy tails which usually dangle from the treetops. As the sheep monkeys sit atop the branches, all but their tails are obscured by the canopy.
