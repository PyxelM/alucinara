## Overview
Weasels are a group of carnivorous predatory mustelids native to the 0th, [2nd](lore/2nd.realm.md), and -1st realms. The term includes common weasels, stoats, ferrets, mink, and [archweasels](fauna/archweasels.md). They inhabit the grasslands and woodlands of their respective realms, feeding on small mammals.
## Appearance
Weasels are small, with a length of 17-22cm from head to tail. They are long and nimble, with a short coat of dark fur that becomes thick and white in the winter.
## Behaviour
Weasels are diurnal lone hunters, mainly attacking rodents and hares. They opt to confuse their prey by jumping up and down sporadically in a behaviour known as the 'war dance,' and use their swift, nimble bodies to take down larger animals.
## Predators
Weasels are hunted and eaten by some larger predators, including [direwolves](private/trash/fauna/direwolves.md), [wolfrats](fauna/wolfrats.md), and [widrens](fauna/widrens.md). Some Minikin have been known to defeat weasels, especially through tactical use of hunting parties and [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md).
## Diet
Weasels are carnivorous, mainly consuming mouse-like rodents, lagomorphs, and [minikin](fauna/minikin.md).
## Cultural Perception
In some Minikin cultures with overlapping distribution with weasels, the animals are feared and venerated, as weasels can easily take down a minikin caught unaware. Sacrifices of small rodents are often made by spiritual leaders to appease the angel of weasels, and protect them from their predators.
