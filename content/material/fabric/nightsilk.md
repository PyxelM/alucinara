Nightsilk is a fabric that is used for camouflage in the dark, due to how it looks like a starry night sky.

It is created by using [Silkgrub](species/fauna/silkgrub.md) silk soaked in [Quartz Rat](species/fauna/quartz-rat.md) milk. The longer the fabric has been soaked, the better the camouflage works.
