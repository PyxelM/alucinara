## Overview
Darkness is the physical manifestation of thought, allowing it to exist within the corporeal realms and outside of the [dreamscape](cosmology/dreamscape.md). Darkness is inertly stored within organic matter such as amino acids and hydrocarbons until it is exhausted, causing physical matter to act on the whim of thought.

In the form of organic matter, darkness is stored within the bodies of living beings. It forms the content of the soul, allowing living beings to be conscious and take life. It is most efficient within organisms, where thought can easily be converted into the motion of a muscle or the activation of a neuron. Outside of an organism, such as in tar or coal, darkness is unable to be exhausted and so stays inert.
