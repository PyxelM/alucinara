## Overview
Darkness is a form of energy used to give life to inanimate matter. It is vital in the existence of life and the soul. Without Darkness, a being cannot be alive, and without [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md), a being cannot be conscious. It can be stored within hydrocarbons, such as tar, amino acids, and other organic compounds.
## The Soul
'The Soul' is the term given to the phenomena of Darkness creating the thoughts, identity, and lived experience of a living being. Darkness is most volatile when stored within the body of living things, through amino acids and proteins, in which state it can assume control of the bodily vessel. It is most inert when stored in non-living hydrocarbons, such as naturally occurring tar or bitumen.
