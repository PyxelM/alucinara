## Overview
Darkness, is an extraneous form of energy which was created shortly after the beginning of the universe and forms the foundation of consciousness and the soul, an integral part of living beings alongside [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) and the physical body.
## Appearance
Darkness lacks a solid appearance, as it is made up of metaphysical particles known as Darknons. However, in high enough concentrations, Darknons absorb light, resulting in a shadowy aura.

Darknons alone are unstable, and evaporate into thermal energy when not contained within Hydrocarbons (amino acids, tar, etc.)
## The Soul
Darkness interacts with Alucinara energy to create the soul. This is achieved when the consciousness-like effects of Alucinara are strengthened and aided by the effects of Darkness, which allow for the phenomenon of thought. Living beings are the most stable place for the soul to exist, due to the presence of amino acids and alucinarium in the body.
