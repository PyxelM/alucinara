## Overview
Alucinara is a form of energy that pertains to the transfer of matter, [thought](cosmology/darkness.md), and other forms of energy between two or more realms. It is vital to the practice of magic, travel between realms, and the existence of consciousness. It is inertly stored within the elemental substance Alucinarium.

When matter, thought, or energy is stored within the [dreamscape](cosmology/dreamscape.md), it does not exist in any physical form, as the dreamscape is an incorporeal realm. Rather, it is suspended until Alucinara energy can transfer it back into physical form.

When thought is transferred from the dreamscape, it is manifested in the form of [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md), which forms the content of the soul within living beings. When darkness is exhausted, it causes thought to act upon the physical realms, triggering effects such as levitation, telepathy, or thermokinesis. It is through this method that many people are made prophets or oracles, especially through contact with incorporeal entities of the dreamscape, often worshipped as deities.
## Magic
Magic is the practice of utilising Alucinara energy in order to manipulate the physical world to achieve a desired effect. In magic, Alucinara is cast through spells or deliberately exposed to the user. Users of magic are known as spellcasters or sorcerers.
