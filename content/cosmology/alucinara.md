## Overview
Alucinara, also known as magic, is a form of energy that alters the ways in which the natural world can operate. It does this by altering the laws of nature in its vacinity from the third laws of nature to the first. It was created by the [first Judge](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-judges.md), in the form of the first laws of nature.
## Appearance
The energy lacks an appearance, but is physically contained within the crystalline mineral of alucium. Alucium is dusty, brittle, dark purple, and shines bright orange, emitting bright orange specks, orbs, and flashes of light when disturbed.
## Origins
Alucinara energy originates as the emminent energy that facilitated the first laws of nature, which were created by the first Judge. When the realms were shattered by the [spirits of darkness](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-spirits-of-darkness.md) and the first was destroyed, new emminent laws of nature were decreed by the second Judge to punish the spirits, but Alucinara was kept, and given physical form in the element of alucium (as were the spirits given physical form in hydrocarbons).
## Biology
The presence of Alucinara on living beings has many effects, such as; the development of the fortuitary gland, where alucium is excreted into the bloodstream for use, and the manipulation of evolution in unexpected and fantastical ways.
## Uses
It can be used to overcome the physical world through processes such as levitation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, hydrokinesis, energy medicine, and prophecy. It can also be used to contact deities through processes such as astral projection, dreams, and visions.
### Examples
Sarqitwara fruit use Alucinara energy to emit bright flashes of light when disturbed as a biological process and defence mechanism when unripe. Similarly, Sapient species use Alucinara energy for many things, including to cook food and manipulate objects from afar.
## Cultural Significance
Alucinara is heavily culturally significant to virtually all cultures outside of the 0th realm, due to its fantastical and strange effects, especially how it can be used to contact incorporeal spirits. It is used in the rituals of some Minikin cultures as a way of speaking to gods.
