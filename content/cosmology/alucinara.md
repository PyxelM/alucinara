## Overview
Alucinara, alucinara energy, or magic, is an immanent form of energy which was created at the beginning of the universe and alters the laws of nature in anomalous and supernatural ways. It is often taken advantage of by living beings in order to manipulate the spiritual and physical world in otherwise unnachievable ways.

Sorcerers are those who specialise in Alucinara use, and are capable of more difficult, high-complexity spells compared to laypeople and nonsapient animals, which may use Alucinara at a lower level of complexity, or simply as a biological process out of evolutionary instinct.
## Appearance
Alucinara energy itself is invisible, as it is not made up of matter, but rather metaphysical particles known as Alucinons. These alucinons can achieve physical form, however, when in high enough concentrations, manifesting as the crystalline element of Alucinarium (`Ac`).

Alucinarium is an iridescent purple crystal with a bright orange lustre. It grows in long, razor-sharp, pyramidal shapes, which can be thin or wide. It is a very bristly crystal, breaking off easily into small chunks and dust. Alucinarium dust generally dissapears, but can have a longer lifespan in areas of high alucinon saturation.
## Uses
Alucinara is capable of doing many things, including:
- Triggering objects to levitate and move,
	- Allowing the practice of self-levitation,
	- Allowing the casting of floating projectiles,
- Manifesting heat, flame, or (deep) cold,
	- Cooking or freezing food,
- Allowing physical beings to communicate with [spiritual beings](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md),
	- Letting users to prophesy, and pray to these spiritual beings,
- Triggering anomalous and even dangerous phenomena,
- Triggering the existence of the soul (consciousness) when interacting with [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md),
- Altering DNA, resulting in evolution in weak concentrations and more drastic mutations in higher concentrations.
## Consciousness
Alucinara energy has many consciousness-like effects, such as a basic system of memory and sensing of the environment, despite being unable to think as living beings do. These effects result in strange phenomena where the universe seems to 'get used' to certain features; this can create apparitions, and entirely out-of-place locations, objects, and 'people.' These phenomena are often impermanent and collapse after a short time.
