## Overview
Alucinara, also known as magic, is a form of energy that alters the ways in which the natural world can operate. It does this by altering the laws of nature in its vacinity from the third laws of nature to the first.
## Appearance
The energy lacks an appearance, but is physically contained within the crystalline element of Alucinarium. Alucinarium is dark purple and shines bright orange, emitting bright orange specks, orbs, and flashes of light when disturbed.
## Biology
The presence of Alucinara on living beings has many effects, such as the development of the fortuitary gland where alucinarium is excreted into the bloodstream for use, and the manipulation of evolution in unexpected and fantastical ways.
### In Tandem with Darkness
Furthermore, when present in tandem with the energy of [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md), the soul is created. Souls are spirits that cannot exist without a physical form, such as in every living being apart from deities (also known as the ancient, incorporeal spirits of darkness), and [the petrified child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md).
## Uses
It can be used to overcome the physical world through processes such as levitation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, hydrokinesis, energy medicine, and prophecy. It can also be used to contact deities through processes such as astral projection, dreams, and visions.
### Examples
Sarkitwara fruit use Alucinara energy to emit bright flashes of light when disturbed as a biological process and defence mechanism when unripe. Similarly, Sapient species use Alucinara energy for many things, including to cook food and manipulate objects from afar.
## Cultural Significance
Alucinara is heavily culturally significant to virtually all cultures outside of the 0th realm, due to its fantastical and strange effects, especially how it can be used to contact incorporeal spirits. It is used in the rituals of some Minikin cultures as a way of speaking to gods.
