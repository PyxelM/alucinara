## Overview
Alucinara, alucinara energy, or magic, is an immanent form of energy which alters the laws of nature in anomalous ways by allowing the 'dreamscape' to affect reality. It is often taken advantage of by living beings in order to manipulate the physical world in supernatural and otherwise unnachievable ways.
## Appearance
Alucinara energy itself is invisible, as it is not made up of matter, but rather metaphysical particles known as Alucinons. These alucinons can achieve physical form, however, when in high enough concentrations, manifesting as the crystalline element of Alucinarium (`Ac`).

Alucinarium is an iridescent purple crystal with a bright orange lustre. It grows in long, razor-sharp, pyramidal shapes, which can be thin or wide. It is a very bristly crystal, breaking off easily into small chunks and dust. Alucinarium dust generally dissapears, but can have a longer lifespan in areas of high alucinon saturation.
## Uses
Alucinara is capable of doing many things. Its use can be unconscious, as in basal organisms and plants, or consciously used as in magic by sapient species. These uses range from allowing users to travel between [realms](cosmology/the-realms.md), levitate objects and themselves, to cook food, to burn or freeze objects, and to commune with [spiritual beings](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) as in prophecy and prayer; although this is not an exhausive list.
## Sorcerers
Sorcerers are those who specialise in Alucinara use, and are capable of more difficult, high-complexity spells compared to laypeople and nonsapient animals, which may use Alucinara at a lower level of complexity, or simply as a biological process out of evolutionary instinct.
## Consciousness
As Alucinara energy provides a bridge between the dreamscape and the corporeal realms, it has many consciousness-like effects. For example, when information is kept within the dreamscape, it can be stored and recalled on command.

It is for this reason that matter and energy can be seen to store and recall memory, resulting in the foundations for the existence of the [soul](cosmology/darkness.md). Furthermore, it also results in the appearance of 'ghosts' when information is recalled and affects the physical world in apparitional ways.
