## Overview
Alucinara is a form of energy used in the transfer of matter, thought, and other forms of energy between the dreamscape and the corporeal realms. It is vital in the existence of magic, cross-realm travel, and consciousness (in tandem with [darkness](cosmology/darkness.md)). It can be stored within the elemental substance Alucinarium.
## Magic
'Magic' is the term given to the phenomena of Alucinara acting in utilitarian ways, such as being cast through [spells](cosmology/alucinara/spellcasting.md) to achieve a desired result by the spellcaster. Magic has existed since eternity, having been used in the creation of the cosmos, the genesis of [deities](cosmology/celestial-beings.md), [Angels](cosmology/celestial-beings/angels.md), their prophets, and religion.
