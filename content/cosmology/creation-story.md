## Overview
The creation story of the universe is characterised by one main event - the shattering of the realms. The universe was created by the two Judges, and shattered by the spirits of darkness.
### The Judges
The Judges, the First and the Second, were the original spirits to reside within the void at the beginning of time. The first judge existed to create matter and the laws of nature, and the second judge existed to keep physical order and advise the first judge, but neither could destroy what they had previously created.
### Darkness, and Spirits of
Out of jealousy for the first judge's power, the second judge created the second laws of nature, which were contained (and hidden) within the energy of Darkness, in an act of rebellion against its companion.

However, the dynamics created in the intersection of the two systems would result in the emergence of the first souls, which were known as the spirits of darkness. The spirits of darkness had not only the power to destroy, but also the need to feed upon matter, or else they would die.
### The Spirit of Goodness
The first judge swiftly found out about the second laws of nature, abhorring the existence of spirits meant to destroy the universe it had created with its companion. In order to govern the darkness, the first judge created the spirit of Goodness, which would slay the spirits, turning them into dust.
### Shattering of the Realms
Despite the efforts of the first judge and the spirit of goodness, the spirits of darkness eventually destroyed a good portion of the universe. And ultimately, the last things to destroy were the judges.

In their attempt to consume the first judge, the spirits of darkness triggered the shattering of the realms, an event so catastrophic that it not only destroyed the first judge, but also split the universe into innumerable separate realms.
### The Third Laws of Nature
The second judge, consumed by regret and loneliness, decided to attempt to make the universe anew, and keep alive the tradition of its companion. It created the third laws of nature to govern every realm, but kept alive the second laws in the energy of Darkness, and the first laws in the energy of Alucinara.
#### Darkness
However, Darkness now required a physical form, which was Hydrocarbons. The only way in which the darkness could affect the world was by functioning as the soul of living beings, originating in the amino acids and organic compounds that are found in all carbon-based lifeforms. In the form of bitumen or tar, the darkness could exist, but not affect the world.
##### Deities
Most of the spirits of darkness were destroyed in the shattering, or trapped within the furthest realms, leading new souls to be created as life began to develop in the new realms. However, some of the spirits of darkness were powerful enough to not only survive but also shift into the central realms and exist incorporeally.

These spirits were only contactable by physical beings through dreams and the use of alucinara energy, and began to be revered as gods by some cultures. As gods, these spirits would perform favours and miracles in return for the prayers and sacrifices from those who followed them.

These gods ranged from good to evil, each having their own personality. The goodest tended to be the most humble, serving the realms in benevolent ways in return for nothing, and the worst tended to enjoy the reverence and praise they recieved, acting malevolently and only well to those who commited acts of evil for them.
#### Alucinara
Likewise, Alucinara similarly required a physical form, which was Alucinarium. Alucinarium affected the world at all times, constantly enforcing the first laws within its vicinity. Eventually, most (excluding the living beings of the 0th realm) living beings would use alucinara energy in some way or other, as a tool or biological process.
#### The Spirit of Goodness
The spirit of goodness' physical form was that of stone; Anywhere there was exposed stone, the spirit of goodness would be able to see and affect the world. The most common manifestation of the spirit of goodness was [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), but [Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) were the second most common.

The Petrified Child's objective, given by the second judge, was to govern the evil (rather than disorder) commited by living beings by turning all evil beings into an extremely fertile substance known as Baby Sludge, which would trigger the proliferation of lush wildlife, but was incredibly dangerous to touch.

As punishment for it's failure to protect the old universe from disorder, it was given the mind and image of a swaddled child, forever cursed to lack maturity and worldliness, and forever cursed to be imprisoned within a body of stone.
