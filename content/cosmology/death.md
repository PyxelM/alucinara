## Overview
Death is the ceasing of life, resulting in the shutting down of the body and the ascention of the [soul](cosmology/darkness.md). It occurs as a result of age, illness, or any other fatal cause, such as thirst or starvation. Death is often feared or venerated, and is an inevitability of life in every living being.
## The Soul
Upon death, the soul 'ascends.' Ascension is a process that causes the soul to be shifted into the [Dreamscape](cosmology/the-realms.md), where its consciousness will be contained for eternity, and the body is left devoid of the soul that once gave it life.
### Soulstones
[Soulstones](phenomena/soulstones.md) are objects made of asphalt or bitumen which are used to contain the soul shortly after death, circumventing the process of ascention. They are used in many cultures as a keepsake of the departed's life.
### Alucinara and Departed Souls
Alucinara can be used in order to access the memories contained within the dreamscape or soulstones. This can occur spontaneously in areas of high alucinarium content, or through purposeful magic use, resulting in apparitions of light or particulate matter that reenact the information being recalled.
## The Body
Upon death, the body will decay or rot. Similar to [Baby Meadows](cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), this allows for the body of a living being to be incorporated back into the natural world and allow it to proliferate and thrive. Decay is an essential part of ecosystems, resulting in processes such as soil formation and land fertilisation.
