## Overview
The dreamscape is the only incorporeal realm. It is where matter, thought, and energy is stored without form, and can be retrieved through the use of [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) to convert such things into physical form, within any of the corporeal realms.

The dreamscape is where incorporeal entities, beings of pure information, or **deities**, reside. Furthermore, it is said that the cosmos was created by an original creator deity through the manifestation of matter and energy from the dreamscape in a time where no such things had yet taken physical form.
