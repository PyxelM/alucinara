## Origin
He worked as a bark harvester as of 50YA but, disheartened by the [Morellic Parliament](cultures/morellic/morelland/parliament.md)'s use of [Glandlings](fauna/artificial/glandlings.md), quit his job for a life of activism after a period of depression and contemplation.

## Activism
He amassed a great following and, in 45 YA, founded the Afortuitites - a group dedicated to urging the discontinued use of [Alucinara Magic](alucinara/alucinarium.md).

When their movement caused no change, however, Kempton decided to do drastic things - he would remove his own Fortuitary Gland, urge his followers to do similarly, and subsequently exodus to the siberian forests of 0Â°e with his group, founding the settlement of Lichenia in 35YA.

This was not without opposition, however - it was decreed that if any afortuitite were to return to Morelland, they would [have their tails removed](cultures/morellic/tail-removal.md) - a humiliating disfigurement.

## Lichenia
It was at Lichenia that [Fungula Moss](characters/lichenia/fungula-moss.md), the daughter of Kempton and [Florifera Moss](characters/lichenia/florifera-moss.md), was born.

However, Kempton's forest paradise would soon come to an end. In 6YA, when Fungula was 14, Kempton would go mad with the want for eternal life.

## Downfall
Knowing his continued existance would require a Fortuitary Gland, something he lacked, he eventually murdered Florifera - but this had dire consequences for his own body, and his community.

Kempton, being introduced to [alucinarium](alucinara/alucinarium.md) for the first time in 30 years, immediately experienced partial [phantasmarrhoea](illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md) along with his wife's Fortuitary Gland as he held it.

## Aftermath
From then on, he would live the rest of his days in the [-3rd Realm](locations/-3rd-realm.md), living off of the alucinara magic in his system, as well as the many odd plants of the world he now found himself within.
