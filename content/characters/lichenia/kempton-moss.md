Kempton Moss, born in 65[YA](timeline/years-ago.md), was notably the founder of the Afortuitites. He worked as a bark harvester as of 50YA but, disheartened by the [Morellic Parliament](cultures/morellic/morelland/parliament.md)'s use of [Glandlings](fauna/artificial/glandlings.md), quit his job for a life of activism after a period of depression and contemplation.

He amassed a great following and, in 45 YA, founded the Afortuitites - a group dedicated to urging the discontinued use of [Alucinara Magic](alucinara/alucinarium.md).

When their movement caused *no* change, however, Kempton decided to do drastic things - he would remove his own [Fortuitary Gland](fauna/biology/fortuitary-gland.md), urge his followers to do similarly, and subsequently exodus to the siberian forests of [0°e](locations/0th-realm.md) with his group, founding the settlement of [Lichenia](cultures/lichenian/lichenia.md).

This was not without opposition, however - it was decreed that if any afortuitite were to return to Morelland, they would [have their tails removed](cultures/morellic/tail-removal.md) - a humiliating disfigurement.

It was at Lichenia that [Fungula Moss](characters/lichenia/fungula-moss.md), the daughter of Kempton and [Florifera Moss](characters/lichenia/florifera-moss.md), was born.
