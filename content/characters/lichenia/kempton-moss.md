Kempton Moss, born in 65[YA](timeline/years-ago.md), was notably the founder of the Afortuitites. He worked as a bark harvester as of 50YA but, disheartened by the [Morellic Parliament](cultures/morellic/morelland/parliament.md)'s use of [Glandlings](fauna/artificial/glandlings.md), quit his job for a life of activism after a period of depression and contemplation.

He amassed a great following and, in 45 YA, founded the Afortuitites - a group dedicated to urging the discontinued use of [Alucinara Magic](alucinara/alucinarium.md).

When their movement caused *no* change, however, Kempton decided to do drastic things - he would remove his own [Fortuitary Gland](fauna/biology/fortuitary-gland.md), urge his followers to do similarly, and subsequently exodus to the siberian forests of [0°e](locations/0th-realm.md) with his group, founding the settlement of [Lichenia](cultures/lichenian/lichenia.md).

This was not without opposition, however - it was decreed that if any afortuitite were to return to Morelland, they would [have their tails removed](cultures/morellic/tail-removal.md) - a humiliating disfigurement.

It was at Lichenia that [Fungula Moss](characters/lichenia/fungula-moss.md), the daughter of Kempton and [Florifera Moss](characters/lichenia/florifera-moss.md), was born.

However, Kempton's forest paradise would soon come to an end. In 6YA, when Fungula was 14, Kempton would go mad with the want for eternal life.

Knowing his continued existance would require a Fortuitary Gland, something he lacked, he eventually murdered Florifera - but this had dire consequences for his own body, and his community.

Kempton, being introduced to [alucinarium](alucinara/alucinarium.md) for the first time in 30 years, immediately experienced partial [phantasmarrhoea](illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md) along with his wife's Fortuitary Gland as he held it.

From then on, he would live the rest of his days in the [-3rd Realm](locations/-3rd-realm.md), living off of the alucinara magic in his system, as well as the many odd plants of the world he now found himself within.
