## Life
### Birth
Coriandra was born in the Autumn of 12 PC to her mother, Priestess and Matriarch of the **Moreillu** clan of the **Mora** tribe, Elkwort (Paurunapiyo), who was aged 16 (24 in human years).

At this time, the clan resided in the sub-equatorial steppe, and herded Yurikh Goats as a group of pastoralist nomads. They had begun to form primitive farms, but subsisted mainly on livestock and wild plants and animals. They would typically not reside in one location for longer than a year, and would only construct temporary settlements.
### Coriandra's Coronation
Elkwort died when Coriandra was young, around 6 years of age (9 in human years), after being wounded by a war party of the **Neth** tribe. This instilled a strong hatred of Nethic people in Coriandra. Elkwort's role as matriarch and priestess was assumed by Coriandra's aunt, Rowan, until Coriandra reached adulthood and was coronated at 12 years of age in the year 1 YC. Coriandra's reign was the first of the house of Coriander and the Coriandric calendar era.

The day before the ceremony of Coriandra's coronation, Rowan made an attempt on Coriandra's life in order to keep hold of power. It is said that Coriandra was so faithful that she was granted clairvoyance of the conspiracy, and prayed that Rowan's plot be hindered. As Coriandra was shaving her head in the evening, she kept a Watchstone amulet with her, which she then used against her aunt as she attempted to drive a blade into her back. Upon seeing this, the Petrified Child came and turned Rowan into dirt. The testimony of this was told by Coriandra at her coronation, and was one of the foundational events that instilled worship of the child among the Morellic people.
### The Morellic Migration
Coriandra's adulthood came at the height of a famine that drove many to turn to thievery and pillaging and to form war parties, such as the Nethic groups that had murdered her mother. As Nethic groups migrated further inland from the west in search of food and resources, the Mora were driven further and further south. In roughly the 10th year of Coriandra's reign, the Mora travelled over the Jana mountains into the Sarvaran river basin, which was then inhabited by the **Diira** tribe.

The migration spanned roughly half a century, but
