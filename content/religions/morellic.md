## Belief System
Gods, to 2nd Realm people, are highly subjective beings whose forms, motivations, and actions alter from which people group you ask. However, every belief system in the 2nd Realm and seldom scattered across others, can be traced to 1 origin, with enough research.

Every one of these systems tend to have things in common. For example, the world was created by a thing, a man, a plant, from a pool, a tar pit, or from space itself.

### Heirarchy of Deities
Lesser gods than the first were created from the continents and the seas, their sons and daughters from the mountains and the valleys, and their sons and daughters from the minerals and the gems that compose the land.

#### The Sons and Daughters of Stone
Some species of the sons and daughters of stone have many diverging forms, given their common ancestors.

A kind was created to be still, to live their days anchored to their ancestors - to gain life from the burning lights in the sky and the nourishing milk of the ground.
Another cowardly kind was created to move, to roam the landscape and gain life from the milk of the ground but not from the burning lights in the sky.
Another, a more courageous kind, was created to gain life from the cowardly kind. They would scream and howl at the heavens that they may gain life from the burning lights, but they were resigned to eat of the cowards and still beings among them.

#### Sapient Life
Many kinds were made to know. Originally, all kinds knew nothing - only to eat, to gain life. But time is unforgiving, static facts of reality mean that life and nature is warped beyond recognition by the inherent gasses and crystals and minerals that the kind that knew called 'Alucinara.'

It warped them from unthinking kinds that eat of the still beings, into thinking kinds that eat of what they wish. They were unrestricted by the rules of being as they developed further into sapient forms.
They continued and continue, living atop the still kind. They eat of the milk of the ground but scream and howl to each other to say their thoughts; ultimately, they are a disruption to the order of nature.

### Creation of the Multiverse
The creation of their vessel is much more interesting than those unorderly beings that take advantage of it.

#### The Perfect Being
Before all else that took place, reality was one - a vast sea of the almost nothing that turned into everything eventually - and a perfect being existed. It explored every land, every mountain, every valley, every river, and eventually every sea and every inch of the abyss after it flowed to shore from where it started.

Following ten-thousand lifetimes and generations and cycles of everything that had been done before, the perfect being broke from the repetition, maybe for the first time, maybe for the last, maybe for the 2nd or may for the 100th time, and stood at the shore of a vast tar pit that bubbled and screamed, anguished and pained, waiting to be more than itself.

#### Origin of the Realms
The perfect being knew what to do. Seeing the bubbles as suitable containers for people and their land, it formed a world within each bubble, each one that turned and ticked according to different but similar laws.

#### Origin of Alucinara
Knowing it had done all that needed to be done in its own world, the perfect being entered the tar pit, and incorporated itself into the inherent makeup of the tar, and allowed the worlds to prosper according to their own rules.

The perfect being became what would later be known as 'Alucinara.'

It manifested itself in every realm as an element which manifested as gasses and crystals and minerals, an element that would become the burning lights in the sky when it knew it was the right time to become so. However, other portions of Alucinara rested in dark solid quartz, sparkling dust-clouds, and dark pitch like the tar that forms the borders of each world.

#### Alucinara as Magic
The thinking kind of children grew to take advantage of the Alucinara, owed to the fact that it gathers in the bodies of all kinds that exist around it. All contained it within an organ of theirs, but the thinking kind would use it to make fire, to fly, to kill, to move across the tar-bubble realms, and to do everything.
