## Overview
The development of agriculture was an event that took place during the neolithic period. The first proto-farmers of Southern Tseireph emerged out of the [Diiran](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/diira.md) hunter-gatherers, who began to cultivate the wild plants of their homeland, and construct the first proto-farms, which formed the basis for the first cities.

The Diiran minikin would go on to migrate throughout Southern Tseireph during the remainder of the neolithic period, in search for more and more fertile land as the population increased. They would conflict with, assimilate, and assimilate into the neighbouring tribes, spreading the practice of farming.
