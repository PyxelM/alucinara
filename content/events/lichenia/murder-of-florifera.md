The murder of Florifera Moss, wife to [Kempton Moss](characters/lichenia/kempton-moss.md), took place in 6YA at the community of [Lichenia](locations/0th-realm/lichenia) after Kempton became delusional with the need for eternal life.

Kempton had removed his [Fortuitary Gland](fauna/biology/fortuitary-gland.md) 24 years prior because of his Afortuitite beliefs that [Alucinara Magic](alucinara/alucinarium) was the root of evil and the tangible manifestation of sin.

However, Kempton in his old age began to lose his mind - becoming less and less adverse to magic until it came to a head in 6YA as he took his wife's life in order to gain eternal life.

Kempton's delusions may have been caused by the decades-long regret for his procedure. Other reasons may have also been a factor, such as Kempton's residence *within* [Lichenia](locations/0th-realm/lichenia), whose people are admittedly of one mind. It is hardly a diverse community of many peoples like modern-day [Amanitaville](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent/morelland/Amanitaville.md).

In all, Florifera's murder was one which caused many effects ill-needed by the [Lichenia](locations/0th-realm/lichenia) population. Florifera was a loved mentor, she taught the children how to weave flax or harvest gum.

In addition, this even also led to the dissapearance of Kempton on account of his partial [phantasmarrhoea](illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md) from touching his wife's gland, which also sent ripples through the community.

Fungula Moss, the couple's daughter, had to rise up from the chaos after the incident and take control of the situation. She was no leader, 14 at the time of the murder, but she managed to calm the people of her community for many reasons.

She was a good communicator and diplomat, which was probably influenced by her mother and, secondly, she was *Fungula Moss.* No Lichenian would dare to oppose a *Moss* - not through fear or malice, but out of pure respect for the man who founded their community and led them away from corruption.
