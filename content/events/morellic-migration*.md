## Overview
The [Morellic](factions/morellic*.md) migration was a migration of the Morellic [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) from the steppes of Southern [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md) across the rest of the continent. The main groups to emerge from the migration were the [Aqhorans](factions/aqhor.md), [Sarvarans](factions/sarvara.md), and [Corothic](factions/corothic.md) minikin. The migration was closely tied to conflict between Morellic and [Nethic](factions/nethic.md) tribes.
## Events
The migration was preceded by local famines, droughts, and resource fighting.
