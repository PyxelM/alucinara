## Overview
The [Morellic](private/factions-old/morellic*.md) migration was a migration of the Morellic [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) from the steppes of Southern [Tseireph](locations/tseireph.md) across the rest of the continent. The main groups to emerge from the migration were the [Aqhorans](private/factions-old/aqhor.md), [Sarvarans](private/factions-old/sarvara.md), and [Corothic](factions/corothic.md) minikin. The migration was closely tied to conflict between Morellic and [Nethic](factions/nethic.md) tribes. The migration was preceded by local famines, droughts, and resource fighting.
