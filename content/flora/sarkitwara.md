## Overview
Sarkitwara is a type of citron fruit, the fruit of the Sarkitwara tree. Sarkitwara trees are native to the mediterranean and hot wilderness regions of the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and 1st realms, and are a common food item for their cohabitant fauna.
## Appearance
Sarkitwara are similar to oranges, with a yellow-orange bumpy shape, around 3cm in diameter. When unripe, they are small and green, and emit bright flashes of [alucinariferous](cosmology/alucinara.md) light in order to stun those who may wish to eat them before they are ready to germinate.

Sarkitwara are divided into 3 to 6 segments, with each section featuring a smooth, hard, back seed at its centre. The segments are easily separatable, and do not require to be peeled to do so, as they tear at the seams and separate from the flesh without much force.

Sarkitwara bushes are around 3 metres in height, with a round shape, with many thick, splaying and winding branches. Their bark is brown, and their leaves yellow and palmate, with three points. Sarkitwara flowers feature pointy red leaves, with a dark red centre where the pollen lies.
## Uses
### Fruit
Sarkitwara are a common and accessible food source, being used in both [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin) and [Nethic](lore/neth.md) food. They are often juiced, and this juice is stored long-term. Furthermore, their skin can be shaved into zest and used as a garnish or in soups and sauces.
