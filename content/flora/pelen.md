## Appearance
Pelen roots are long, fleshy, and red in complexion. They can reach from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bulbous mid-section that tapers off in each end. Their leaves are large and green, usually the only part of the plant visible from the surface.
## Uses
### Root
Pelen roots are often chopped, boiled, and / or roasted for use in salads, soups, and various other dishes. They are slightly sweet in taste.
### Leaves
Pelen leaves are often used raw in salads, providing a crunchy source of nutrients and water. They are also suitable for consumption in the wild, making them an easy snack for foragers.
