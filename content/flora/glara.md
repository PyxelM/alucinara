## Overview
Glara are a species of tree native to the tropical rainforests of the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and -2nd realms. They bear luminescent fruit, common in [Nethic](lore/2nd-realm/nethic.md) food.
## Appearance
Glara trees are tall, reaching up to 50 metres in height. Their branches wave and twist as they go upward, and their trunks are not straight, with wide bases up to 3 metres in diameter. Their bark is grey-brown, and their leaves obtuse and grey-purple. Glara fruit are pear-shaped and luminescent, glowing a blue-purple colour with the aid of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md).
## Use
### Bases
The base of Glara trees are wide, and are often hollowed out and used as shelters by the Neth. They are also used to keep item safe, such as valuables or food.
### Fruit
Glara fruit are a mainstay in Nethic cooking. They are toxic when eaten raw, and so are boiled in water to leech out the bulk of the Alucinarium. Upon boiling, they are soft and fluffy, similar to sweet potatoes, and eaten as a side dish.
