## Overview
Sweetrice is a type of domesticated cereal grain native to the southwestern continent of the  [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). It is a staple crop for the minikin of [Aqhor](lore/2nd-realm/oyholiric/aqhor*.md), who brought it to the Sarvaran river basin from their homeland.
## Appearance
Sweetrice is green and stalky, reaching up to 2 metres in height. Their seeds are hard and purple, and once shucked (and cooked), they are light and pink, similar to rice.
## Uses
### Grain
Sweetrice grains are used in [Aqhoran](lore/2nd-realm/oyholiric/aqhor*.md) cooking, boiled in water and eaten alone or with accompanying foodstuffs. Sweetrice is generally not eaten by other cultures, with a heavy cultural tie to Aqhor.
