## Overview
Asaran trees are a species of evergreen conifer trees native to the mediterranean regions of the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). They bear small, berry-like cones, which are used in cooking, and light wood which is used to make tools.
## Appearance
In appearance, Asarans are similar to cedar trees, reaching up to 40 metres in height. Their branches reach over wide distances, and the bark is generally dark grey-brown, with the leaves having a musty green colour. Their cones are small, purple and fleshy, only around 1 to 2 cm in size.
