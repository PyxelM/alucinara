## Overview
Creepvine is a species of plant native to the forests of the -1st and -3rd realms. It commonly grows upon other plants, such as [ribwood](flora/ribwood.md), acting as a parasitic weed.
## Appearance
Creepvine is long, thin, and weedy. It is dark-purple, almost black in complexion, with small palmate leaves. It dangles, winds, and hoops around branches and rocks, seemingly with no end. It would be futile to guess the length it can reach.
