## Overview
Nyuta is a type of berry, the fruit of the Nyuta bush. Nyuta bushes are native to the plains of the [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) and 1st realms, and their leaves form the main ingredient in Nyuta tea; they are scarcely found aside from orchards, and are a high-class symbol.

Nyuta bushes contain high concentrations of [alucinarium](cosmology/alucinara.md), leading to a purple hue, with many toxic and hallucinogenic effects upon consumption. However, the berries are safe to eat.
## Appearance
Nyuta bushes are short, usually only 2-3 metres in height. Their bark is brown-purple, and their leaves a purple-red. Nyuta berries are around 2cm in length, egg-shaped, red, and grow in clusters.
## Uses
### Berries
Nyuta berries are a common food among nobility, serving as a sweet treat, and are often juiced into purple Nyuta wine.
### Leaves
Nyuta leaves are often collected and used in tea, but are toxic on their own. Nyuta tea is hallucinogenic, and is of great importance within many religions; within Morellic spirituality, it is consumed by spiritual leaders to commune with deities.
