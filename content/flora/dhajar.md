## Overview
Dhajar trees are a species of coniferous tree native to the continental forests of the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). Their wood is a common material in carpentry, especially in [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/coroth.md) and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child).
## Appearance
Dhajar trees are tall, reaching up to 45 - 55m in height, and their diameters can reach up to 1.5 metres in width. Their trunks are generally straight, but can enlarge at the base to up to 3 metres. It is only in the canopy that the branches splay out and the needles and pinecones are grown.
## Uses
### Pinecones
Dhajar pinecones are inedible, but are used for decoration and for smoking meat. They are often found adorning Corothic structures and head dresses.
### Sap
Dhajar sap is used in Dhajar syrup, a mainstay in [Corothic](lore/2nd-realm/coroth.md) cooking. Dhajar syrup is sweet, viscous, brown in complexion, and is often paired with bread, cereals, and nuts.
