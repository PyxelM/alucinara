Longleaf trees have been a favourite for nest building even during the time of the Proto-Morellic culture in 7,000YA.[^1]

## Morphology
Their leaves hang from the branches, featuring a coiling tendril which eventually widens to a long banner-like leaf which tapers into a point.

## Utilisation
### Treatment
They are treated by Minikin in order to increase durability, which involves a series of hammering the leaves, drying the leaves, and covering the leaves in a resin-like substance known as Leatherjuice, to give it a leather-like quality.


### Uses
It is then used as a canvas for artwork or heraldry, and is often as an outer clothing item.
