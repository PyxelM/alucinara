## Overview
Lunuth wheat is a type of domesticated cereal grain native to the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). It is a staple crop for many cultures, especially of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md), by whom it was domesticated. It played an instrumental role in the history of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) and agriculture as a whole.
## Appearance
Lunuth is beige-green and stalky, and can reach up to a metre in height. It features small, pink grains which are flanked by large, dry leaves, and often grows in vast Lunuth fields and tilled land.
## Uses
### Grain
Lunuth grains are a very useful resource. They are used in animal fodder and birdfeed, and also ground into flour, which can be baked into a bread known as Megri. Megri is a mainstay in Sarvaran, Stonechild Imperial, and Morellic cooking.
### Leaves
Lunuth leaves proved useful during the Bronze age, when they were harvested and used in the development of writing. The Sarvaran abugida was written into Lunuth leaves using a stylus to etch glyphs into the page, and then coated with ink to highlight the written text.
