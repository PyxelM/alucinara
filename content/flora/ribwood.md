## Overview
Ribwood trees are a species of tree native to the forests and jungles of the -3rd realm.
## Appearance
Ribwood trees are long and winding, with eponymous ribbed bark that repeats in rings along the trunk. The base starts off wide, reaching a diameter of 3 metres, but tapers off into a long trunk that winds off for miles in the direction of light, without many branches. Their wood, bark, and leaves are dark and purple, with their leaves whorled around the creases of the ribs.
## Uses
## Wood
Ribwood is commonly used in wealthy fortifications, as it is virtually immune to the effects of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md). Thusly, mages and warriors cannot penetrate it, but it is incredibly dangerous to source due to its native realm.
