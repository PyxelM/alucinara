## Overview
The Naíruan Extinction Event began to take place when the Móra riSéwi Minikin brought the [curse of hollowness](phenomena/curses/hollowness) to the city of Naíru. It was one of the first Extinction Events in recorded history, although there has been evidence of dozens more, as seen in sediment layers.

## Deaths
It resulted in the deaths of thousands of [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md), mostly Oyhóliru minikin, Foreign slaves in Naíru, and Móra riSéwi minikin. Notable deaths are [Grasscap](characters/grasscap.md), the Móra riSéwi leader, and [Mooncloud](characters/mooncloud.md), the co-regnant ruler of Naíru with her sister.

## Ending
The extinction event ended once the plague caused by the curse of hollowness had died out, mostly with the help of the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), which created a Baby Meadow in the heart of Naíru, indirectly causing the deaths of many infected.

Another help was the extermination of the infected, as seen when the Móra riSéwi threw infected into the sea as they migrated southwest, and the Oyhóliru minikin burnt the infected. The last victim of the plague died around 150 years following its beginning.
