Silkgrubs, of the family *Dolbaserica*, are small herbivorous insects that produce silk, native to the [2nd Realm](geography/2nd-realm.md).

They exhibit neoteny in that they often do not metamorphose into adults, rather using the silk meant for their cocoon as shelter-building material, to stay warm and dry.

They inhabit the [Central Continent](geography/2nd-realm/central-continent.md)'s equatorial rainforest (*Sericifera erucula*), and its many other deciduous forests (*Sericifera foliphagia*).

Their silk is used for;
- [Nightsilk](material/fabric/nightsilk.md)
- [Morellic Drape](material/fabric/morellic-drape.md)
- [Neth Fleece](material/fabric/neth-fleece.md)

Due to silkgrubs' high populations in forests, the [Morellic](cultures/morellic.md) and [Neth](cultures/neth.md) cultures both often utilise their silk. Adversely, the [Snixian](cultures/snixian) culture often uses [goat wool](material/fabric/goat-wool) due to their position atop the [Snixian Alps](geography/realms/2nd-realm/central-continent/snixian-alps.md).
