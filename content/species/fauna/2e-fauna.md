## Minikin
[Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) are a sapient rodent species native to the 2nd realm. They are descended from the European Red Squirrel, and grew to become the most populous intelligent race of the 2nd Realm. They are capable of speech, agriculture, forming civilisations, and all of the other skills and industries that come with them.
### Sociology
Early Minikin groups were nomadic foragers and hunter-gatherers, living in familial clans which were united in tribes, united in cultures, united in races. Later Minikin groups settled down in arboreal cities, forming city states and, even later, nation states.
### Diet
Minikin are mostly herbivores, consuming fruits, nuts, leaves, vegetables, and treebark. Due to other forces, such as the development of cooking technology or food scarcity, Minikin also eat various forms of bread such as Lunuth bread, dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, and alcoholic drinks such as beer and fruit wine.
## Bushdeer
[Bushdeer](species/fauna/bushdeer.md) are a ruminant species native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They are related to Earth deer, with the major differences being their tree-like antlers, distinct white stripes on their sides, and skull-like white markings on their faces.
### Diet
Bushdeer are herbivorous, their main source of food being leaves and moss. They sometimes eat other foods, such as algae, fungi, and small animals.
### Antlers
Their antlers, their most striking feature, exhibit robust, vascularised, green pseudo-leaves; these leaves contain chloroplasts taken from the various photosynthetic organisms in the bushdeer's diets, and provide the animal with an extra source of energy.
### Play-Dead Reflex
When bushdeer undergo the instinctual play-dead reflex, the rib-like stripes and skull-like facial markings help to mask their bodies from predators, giving the impression that they have already been fully scavenged and begun to rot.
## Pygmy Bushdeer
Pygmy bushdeer are a part-arboreal, smaller version of common bushdeer. They are venerated by the Morellic minikin as sacred animals, and are thus forbidden to be killed in Morellic culture.

They are used as mounts by some Minikin cultures, including the Morellic, who ride them during religious ceremonies and pilgrimages. Other nomadic cultures ride them to find new areas for their livestock to graze.
## Giant Snails
Giant snails are a gastropod species native to the 2nd realm. They are large, about the same height as Minikin from their foot to the top of their shells. Their diet consists of leaves and vegetables.
### Pack Snails
Pack snails are the domesticated version of giant snails. They are used by some Minikin cultures to transport goods such as spices and grains, in which case their shells are fitted with a saddle and utility belts featuring tools and cargo pouches, travelling in often guarded caravans headed by merchants.
