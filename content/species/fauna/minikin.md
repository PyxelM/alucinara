## Overview
Minikin were a small rodent species native to the 2nd realm. They were arboreal omnivores which tended toward eating nuts and other plants, and descended from red squirrels from the 0th realm. They were capable of language, and appeaedr anthropoid.

## Adaptation
Many red squirrels that had found themselves in the 2nd realm as a result of the Supernova of 80MB, and were subsequently put under a lot of pressure from similarly arboreal predators. This led to the adaptation of;
- stronger legs and digitigrade feet for the ability to jump,
- greater agility and capacity for stealth,
- and sharper claws and teeth for self defence.

## Morphology
Minikin measured at a height of 25-30cm tall. The basal minikin grew to develop hairlessness and bipedalism, with strong, long digitgrade feet specialised for jumping from branch to branch.

They also grew to look a lot more anthropoid, as the same alucinara energy that had augmented their evolution was the same energy that had developed muscle memory from use in the souls of late humans that had gone extinct soon after the supernova.

### Fur Distribution
Hairlessness and / or fur distribution could vary from race to race depending on the climate. Hotter climates would result in sparser, thinner fur, with the opposite effect in cooler climates. As a rule, the head tended to have hair, and the tail was always fuzzy and bushy.

For example, the equatorial Morello-Oyhoyunic minikin were almost completely hairless apart from their heads, genitals, and tails. In contrast, the southern alpine Snissojian minikin were hairy all over apart from their faces and palms, covered with fluffy white fur to adapt to their cold, snowy environment.

### Eyes
Minikin skin colour could vary from dark to light, often taking on a semi-dark beige colour. Eye colour could vary from brown, to green, or to blue. In cases of prolongued [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) exposure, the irises would take on a light pink or purple colour.

## Diet
As omnivores, minikin often tend to eat;
- insects,
- berries,
- nuts,
- leaves,
- tree bark,
- and small rodents.

Some minikin guilty of comitting a taboo would be fed potentially poisonous foods, as to gauge their toxicity, and some minikin cultures would abstain from consuming squirrel flesh, due to their sanctity in a lot of religions as the minikin's evolutionary and spiritual ancestors.

## Sociality
Minikin often tended to form groups based on familial relation, headed by a matriarch. Minikin would exhibit altruism in sharing food with others of their own group, giving and allowing others to freely take from each other's midden(s).

### Communities
As they developed, the basal minikin developed a more sophisticated capacity for the formation of society, language, and the ability to construct permanent buildings such as workplaces and small clay dormitories or middens.

Minikin groups would inhabit small wooded areas, with one to three immediate families living in one tree. Portions of these trees were often hollowed out for use as storage or shelter, while some cultures would store clay in their cheek pouches to build round shelters dangling from the branches.

### Taboos
When a minikin commited a crime, they would be ostracised from the community and have their tail dismembered and burnt. In morellic culture, tails were seen as the source of the spirit or soul, and the disconnection from the soul was representative of the disconnection of the individual from others. The legal definition of what constituted a 'crime' could vary depending on each culture's taboos.

### Instability
When a group got too large for one community, it would inevitably collapse. Two or three new groups could form following the split, involving fighting, war, and ostracism. Large groups were often unstable, resulting in violent dictatorships in some communities as to reduce the risk of collapse.

## Psychology
Minikin psychology was a complicated subject on account of the brain's interaction with the Fortuitary gland. The brain was accountable for conscious and subconscious processes, such as thought, decision-making, breathing, sleep, hibernation, including the control of all other biological systems. Likewise, the fortuitary gland was accountable for the subconscious process of alucinarium secretion and frequencial shift.

However, the line became blurred between each organ when one researched the subject of dreaming and sorcery. Dreams, while mostly innocuous to non-fortuitous beings, were greatly debated in the context of Alucinara, wether or not they originated from the brain or from a spiritual plane.

### Hibernation
All minikin hibernated in the winter, slowing their metabolic processes following a period of feasting. During hibernation, minikin became unconscious in a sleep-like state and alucinarium levels in the brain would increase due to the inactivation of valves in the bloodstream that protected the brain from Phantasmarrhoea.

This was not seen in minikin sleep, but was shown to increase the vividness of dreams during hibernation. The presence of alucinarium in the brain during hibernation was a survival method developed to allow minikin to interface with deities, to gain foreknowledge such as future events or advice through acquisition of divine wisdom.
