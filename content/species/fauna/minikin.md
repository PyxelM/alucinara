## Lifespan
The average Minikin lifespan is 30 years, and they reach maturity at 8-12 years of age.

However, the Minikin lifespan can be lengthened through [Alucinarium](alucinara/alucinara.md) exposure.

## Morphology
### Height
When Minikin are born, they are often 2.5cm to 7.5cm in height.

At maturity, they often reach a height of 20cm to 30cm.

### Eyes
Minikin eyes are on the front of their head and feature long, bristly eyelashes.

The colour of the Minikin iris can vary. Common iris colours are maroon, brown, green, and dark mauve.

In addition, the colours of minikin sclerae are almost always white, but can also be light pink due to [Alucinarium](alucinara/alucinara.md) exposure.

### Hair
Minikin exhibit hair only on their heads, chins, tails, and pubic areas. They also feature whiskers on their top lips.

However, as infants, they feature hair all over their bodies except for their fingers, toes, and face. After the first year, all of this hair is lost.

Minikin hair colour can express itself as brown, beige, grey, ginger, or white.
