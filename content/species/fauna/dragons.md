## Overview
Dragons, native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), are a small amphibian species capable of flight. They are characterised by their 6 limbs and their ability to breathe fire as a defence mechanism, and serve as a food for many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.

## Life Cycle
### Egg Phase
Dragon eggs are commonly laid in the dawn of spring, due to the presence of ponds and puddles which dry up by summer. The eggs have the appearance of frogspawn, only featuring a sticky membrane on the outside to serve as protection and to latch onto the undersides of pond leaves.

### Nymph Phase
Dragon nymphs are very small aquatic creatures. They largely feed on plankton, algae, and small organisms, and inhabit the pond in which they were born until they reach adulthood.
