## Overview
The Ikplik is a [mundozoan](species/mundozoa.md) animal native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm). Descended from meerkats, they retain their size, pack structure, and appearance despite their shift into the niche of herbivores native to grassland habitats.

Their name derives from the throaty, high-pitched distress calls that they make when under threat, mostly from minikin hunters.
## Cultural Relevance
The cultural relevance of Ikpliks to minikin vary from culture to culture. To the [Morellic](groups/morellic-minikin.md) minikin, ikpliks are treated as both pets and livestock; sheared for their wool, skinned for their pelt, and used to enrich farm soil.

They are rarely eaten by all races but the [austerkin](groups/austerkin) as their diet results in the accumulation of toxins in their flesh. When cooked, the toxins are deactivated, but can still pose a threat if undercooked.

Austerkin eat ikpliks as a delicacy, as their diet is similar enough to ikpliks that the effects of the toxins is nullified.
## Morphology
Ikpliks are identical to meerkats except for in a few respects; they not only have an extra pair of limbs, but also employ the use of [alucinara](deities/alucinara.md) energy as a defence mechanism.
## Diet
The diet of ikpliks is defined by its mainly herbivorous nature; the main food sources for ikpliks are;
- grass
- leaves
- berries
- insects
