## Nyuta Bushes
Nyuta bushes are a type of bush native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have red leaves and purple berries. Nyuta leaves are dried and consumed in a purple tea by many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.
### Nyutaberries
Nyutaberries are small, edible, and purple. They have pink stems and near-white mesocarps which contain many small black seeds. They are foraged by some Minikin cultures.
### Nyuta Tea
Nyuta tea is favoured for its hallucinogenic effects when consumed in large quantities, leading the drink to have a lot of spiritual significance to some cultures. However, a drink or two won't hurt.
## Sarkitwara Trees
Sarkitwara trees are a type of citron tree native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have yellow leaves and orange, segmented fruit.
### Sarkitwara
Sarkitwara themselves are the plants' segemented orange fruits. Their segments can be removed whole, and individually peeled, revealing a pithy orange-like flesh, with large black seeds within.

When unripe, the fruit releases flashes of light when disturbed, through the use of [alucinara](deities/alucinara.md). This is to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat the fruit before it is ready to germinate.

Wild Sarkitwara are foraged by some minikin cultures, and some varieties were domesticated, such as the Morellic Sarkitwara, which began to be cultivated in orchards by the Sarvaran minikin.
### Pelen
Pelen is a plant native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They are similar to carrot plants, only with larger, wider, red roots, and are farmed by many Minikin cultures.
### Pelenroots
Pelenroots are the large root vegetable of the Pelen plant. They are large, wide, and feature a deep red hue. They are eaten by many minikin cultures and are typically boiled before consumption.
### Pelen Leaves
Pelen Leaves are the leaves of the Pelen plant. They are large, green, and edible. They are eaten by some minikin cultures, using them similar to lettuce.
### Pelen Red
Pelen Red is a dye engineered by the Sarvaran minikin, taken from the deep red colour of Pelenroots, which get their colour from high concentrations of betanin and carotene. 
## Lunaflower Plants
Lunaflower plants are native to the 2nd and -3rd realms. They feature delicate purple flowers.
### Lunaflowers
Lunaflowers have purple and pink petals, with a moon-like white centre where many sub-flowers and their seeds are kept, like sunflowers of Earth. It is foraged by some minikin cultures, eaten on their own, and pressed into Lunaflower oil.
### Lunaflower Oil
Lunaflower oil is transparent and pink. It is squeezed out of Lunaflowers and used in many situations, including anointing, cooking, and lubrication.
## Lunuth Wheat
Lunuth wheat is a grass native to the 2nd realm. It is the domesticated version of Lunuth wildgrass, and was one of the first plants to be farmed by the early Sarvaran civilisation.
### Lunuth Grains
Lunuth wheat produces small grains with hard, purple hulls. These grains are typically ground into light pink lunuth flour, or pressed into crimson lunuth oil.
### Lunuth Bread
Lunuth bread has been a staple food of many minikin cultures, even non-agricultural groups. It has a slight purple hue beside from being mainly beige and brown. It is typically leavened, sprinkled with Nyuta seeds, and eaten with lunaflower oil.
### Lunuth-based Textiles
As well as being able to be turned into bread, Lunuth is farmed by some minikin cultures for it's long, flax-like fibres, which are turned into thread or woven into Lunuth fabric. In some regions of Qherell, Lunuth was the first plant to be used in textiles, revolutionising the craft for the Sarvaran Civilisation.
## Glowpear Trees
Glowpear trees are a type of tree native to the 2nd and -1st realms. Their leaves are deep green and their fruit are glowing blue. They are grown in orchards by some Minikin cultures.
### Glowpears
Glowpears are the fruit of the glowpear tree. They are similar to pears, with the main difference being their luminous, vibrant blue-cyan colour. Their juice similarly glows, owing to the presence of [alucinarium](deities/alucinara.md). They are sometimes foraged by some Minikin cultures.
### Glowpear Leaves
Glowpear Leaves are the leaves of the glowpear tree. They are shiny, with a deep green complexion. They are inedible to Minikin, but serve as a vital food source for herbivorous livestock such as treepigs, wooly bushdeer, and pack-snails.
