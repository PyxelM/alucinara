## Nyuta Bushes
Nyuta bushes are a type of bush native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They have red leaves and purple berries. Nyuta leaves are dried and consumed in a purple tea by many [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) cultures.
### Nyuta Berries
Nyuta berries are small, edible, and purple. They have pink stems and near-white mesocarps which contain many small black seeds. They are foraged by some Minikin cultures.
### Nyuta Tea
Nyuta tea is favoured for its hallucinogenic effects when consumed in large quantities, leading the drink to have a lot of spiritual significance to some cultures. However, a drink or two won't hurt.
## Sarkitwara Trees
Sarkitwara trees are a type of citron tree native to the 2nd and 1st realms. They have yellow leaves and orange, segmented fruit.
### Sarkitwara
Sarkitwara themselves are the plants' segemented orange fruits. Their segments can be removed whole, and individually peeled, revealing a pithy orange-like flesh, with large black seeds within.

When unripe, the fruit releases flashes of light when disturbed, through the use of [alucinara](deities/alucinara.md). This is to deter herbivores who may attempt to eat the fruit before it is ready to germinate.

Wild Sarkitwara are foraged by some minikin cultures, and some varieties were domesticated, such as the Morellic Sarkitwara, which began to be cultivated in orchards by the Sarvaran minikin.
## Lunuth Wheat
Lunuth wheat is a grass native to the 2nd realm. It is the domesticated version of Lunuth wildgrass, and was one of the first plants to be farmed by the early Sarvaran civilisation.
### Lunuth Bread
Lunuth bread has been a staple food of many minikin cultures, even non-agricultural groups. It has a slight purple hue beside from being mainly beige and brown. It is typically leavened, sprinkled with Nyuta seeds, and eaten with lunaflower oil.
## Lunaflower plants
Lunaflower plants are native to the 2nd and -3rd realms. They feature delicate purple flowers.
### Lunaflowers
Lunaflowers have purple and pink petals, with a moon-like white centre where many sub-flowers and their seeds are kept, like sunflowers of Earth. It is foraged by some minikin cultures, eaten on their own, and squeezed into Lunaflower oil.
### Lunaflower Oil
Lunaflower oil is transparent and yellow. It is squeezed out of Lunaflowers and used in many situations, including anointing, cooking, and lubrication.
