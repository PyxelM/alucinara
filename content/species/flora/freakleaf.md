## Overview
Freakleaf is the name given to a plant native to the [1st Realm](locations/1st-realm.md). It is nonpoisonous and has yellow leaves which are fermented, dried, ground into a power, and dissolved in water. 

Following the fermentation process, the leaves become poisonous to many animals, but are consumed by many [Minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) populations in a tea socially or recreationally for their slight intoxicative effects.

## Appearance
Freakleaf trees themselves feature purple wood, with blue and green highlights.

- When fresh, their leaves are smooth, thick, fuzzy, and range from a yellow colour, to orange or red, with dark brown spots.
- Following fermentation, the leaves lose their thickness, appearing as flat raisins, with a uniform dark brown colour.
- Following drying, the leaves appear thin, crispy, and red.
- When ground into a powder, the powder appears red, glistening yellow.
- When dissolved into a drink, the liquid appears transparent with a deep red-orange tint.

## Intoxicative Effects
The effects of Freakleaf tea are characterised by slight hallucination, vivid sight, slurring of speech, sluggish movement, and temporary loss of control over one's body in extreme cases. Prolonged consumption of Freakleaf tea results in blindness and risk of phantasmarrhoea, due to the [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) content in the leaves.

## Religious Significance
Freakleaf tea is religiously significant to many Minikin groups, being consumed in rituals by the [Móra riSéwi](groups/mora-risewi-tribe.md) and [Morellic Minikin](groups/morellic-minikin.md).

The hallucinations, while mostly non-intrusive, are seen as invisible objects and beings made visible by the deities upon consumption of the tea. These hallucinations are interpreted by spiritual leaders as having hidden meaning, and are used in rituals as ways to telling the future and / or receiving spiritual guidance.
