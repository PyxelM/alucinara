## Overview
Nyutaberry trees are a type of tree native to the 2nd and 3rd realms. They are small, stout, low-lying shrubs, with deep crimson leaves and violet fruits known as Nyutaberries, whose surfaces are similar to persimmon, and their insides similar to citrons and plums.
## Fruit
### Appearance and Anatomy
Nyutaberries appear small, violet-coloured, and pear-shaped. Their epicarp contains a lot of retinol and alucinarium, hence their violet colour, and pink insides. They have a thin mesocarp that surrounds an edible endocarp and a hard, black stone.
### Eating Practices
Nyutaberries are poisonous and phantasmous when raw, but can be cooked to disable all toxins and release all alucinarium content. In a cooked state, Nyutaberries are mushy and sweet, and are eaten with a spoon, straight, or as a puree with other ingredients.
## Leaves
Nyutaleaves are deep crimson-coloured, with a lanceolate, palmate shape. They are phantasmous when raw, but can be dried and crushed into a tea known as Nyutaleaf Tea.
## Tea
Nyutaleaf Tea is a drink consumed by many cultures for religious and recreational means. Due to it's high alucinarium content, it causes hallucinations and Alucinara increase in the consumer.
### Cultural Significance
Due to these effects, it gained a very special role in many cultures. In Morellic culture, it was consumed by spiritual leaders and monks for it's religious significance; interpretation of Nyutaleaf-induced visions was an important aspect of Sarvaran religion.

In Morellic culture also, it was sometimes consumed for recreational purposes, as a drug. However, it was seen as a great blasphemy to consume it to this end, and consumption was met with puishments that ranged from imprisonment to execution.
