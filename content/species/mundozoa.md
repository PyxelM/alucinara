## Overview
Mundozoa is the term for the paraphyletic group of all animals native to the essent realms that genetically originate from the fauna of the 0th realm.

As per their paraphyly, they are not a group with common ancestry in the traditional sense. All mundozoans are descended from the first animal, but not all animals are mundozoans.
## Origin
The mundozoans have their origin mainly in the [Supernova](lore/creation-story.md). This supernova led to the mass-essential shift of matter into the essent realms; including living matter.
### Morphology
Due to the high levels of [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy in the shockwave, some morphological changes took place upon the event of the supernova. Some of these include;
- The presence of a third pair of legs in former tetrapods
- The presence of magical abilities
- The ability to breathe underwater in terrestrial animals
- The ability to breathe air in aquatic animals
- Wings in flightless animals
- A lack of wings in flying animals.
