**Alucinara** is a book first created by Mylo J. Hodges[^1] in November of 2021 during a creative writing mock-test. This website is the documentation of this book, and thus features articles about the many locations, characters, foods, languages, and realms of this book's universe.

You can find the artwork I have made for Alucinara here on my [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/pyxelmusic)!
