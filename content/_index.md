title: "Alucinara"
---
Alucinara is a book that explores anthropology, fantasy ethics, and the right to 'save' the world through a cast of three characters;
- one a immature and naive [Minikin](species/fauna/sapient/minikin.md) bandit called [Toadstool](characters/toadstool.md),
- another a culture-shocked but ambitious [Demi-Slug](species/demi-slug.md) vagabond called [Blueberry](characters/blueberry.md),
- and the other a young, cautious Minikin stateswoman called [Fungula](characters/fungula.md).
These characters are all with differing opinions, attributes, and motives for their actions.

## Note from the author:
I conceived the book in November 2021 during a creative writing mock-test. Since, I have been continually developing it and exploring new ideas for its direction.

You can find the artwork I have made for Alucinara at my [Deviant Art](https://www.deviantart.com/pyxelmusic), and the music I have made for it at my [Bandcamp](https://pyxelm.bandcamp.com)
