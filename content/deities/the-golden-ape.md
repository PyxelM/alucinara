## Overview
The golden ape, also known as 'Truth,' is a deity through which all knowledge is learnt, practised, and made known. It has a similar manifestation to that of the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) but has the appearance of a gibbon made of gold.
## Appearance

The golden ape appears as with a smooth body with a shape akin to a stout inverse pear, with a small simian face with eyes and a nose, and marked ridges and bumps that emulate the appearance of hands and feet.

It measures with a length of 3 metres, floats above the ground, and is made of pure gold. It has glowing orange eyes made of [alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) that are kept closed when the deity is inactive.
## Purpose
The purpose of the golden ape is to know everything that is capable of being known, and contain all truth. Through the ape, all laws of nature are followed, and all knowledge is made known.

It is because of this knowledge of everything that the ape suffers from constant disappointment and sadness at the vast presence of evil within the universe. It often refuses to divulge answers to those who come across it.

The ape imposed limits upon the knowledge of living beings so that they shouldn't know everything, as all obstacles could be overcome for good or evil, and every living thing would be burdened with its own knowledge and sadness.
