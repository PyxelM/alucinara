## Overview
The Darkness is a deity derived from the force of the same name, from before the shattering of the realms. It controls the ways in which life may destroy beauty, restricting living beings with the prospect of death and injury.
## Appearance
Upon physical manifestation, the Darkness took the form of hydrocarbons. It is commonly found in tar, bitumen, or viable bodies, and is most active in the amino acids within a living being.
## Behaviour
Upon combination with [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy, the Darkness manifests the Soul. Upon combination with a viable body, the Soul manifests a living being, with the capacity for thought and life.

Upon the expiry of a viable body or soul, the Darkness returns to the Pond, the void space between realms. This can be circumvented by storing the Darkness of the deceased's soul within a [soulstone](phenomena/soulstone.md), which function a similar role as urns or ashes.
