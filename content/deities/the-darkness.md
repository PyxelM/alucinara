## Overview
The Darkness, also known as 'Life,' is a deity that governs the way in which living beings operate. Derived from the force of Life, it lacks a physical form, functioning as life energy. It manifests its influence in hydrocarbons.
## Appearance
Hydrocarbons, through which the Darkness operates, are found in tar, bitumen, and organic compounds such as amino acids (as in living beings.)
## Behaviour
Upon combination with [Alucinara](deities/alucinara.md) energy, the Darkness manifests the Soul. The soul is what creates a living being from an inanimate body, allowing the capacity for action and thought.
## Death
Upon expiry of a body, the Darkness leaves the body and returns to the Pond, dissipating the soul. This is sometimes circumvented by storing the deceased's soul within a [soulstone](phenomena/soulstone.md).
