## Overview
Sarvaran was a Morellic language spoken in the Sarvaran civilisation during the Minikin bronze-age. It was polysynthetic, head-final, and head-marking, with an SOV word order.
### Chronology
Sarvaran descended from Proto-Morellic, which was spoken by the Early Morellic nomads in the southern half of Tseireph during the Early Morellic Period.

Through Old Sarvaran and Middle Sarvaran, it developed into its Classical form, which was spoken during the Sarvaran Golden Age. It was during this time that the majority of the language's poetic works, songs, and prose were composed.

Eventually, it developed into Vulgar Sarvaran, its more colloquial register. And after the Sarvaran Collapse, it developed during the Morellic Dark Ages into Stonechild Imperial. This language was spoken in the Empire of the Petrified Child, while Classical Sarvaran was kept as a liturgical, artistic language, by the time of the Morellic Renaissance Period.

There are many allophonic rules in Sarvaran, owing to the language's historical forms and sound changes. One such rule is that voiced obstruents devoice when not proceeded by a voiced phone, exept when at the beginning of a word. Another is that oral occlusives and alveolar liquids lenite in coda position, like thus:

| **Plain** | **Lenited** |
| --------- | ----------- |
| p         | ɸ \<ph>     |
| b         | β \<bh>     |
| t̪        | θ \<th>     |
| d̪        | ð \<dh>     |
| t͡ʃ       | ʃ \<c>      |

| q         | χ \<qh>     |
| g         | ɣ \<gh>     |
| r         | r̥ \<rh>    |
| l         | ɬ \<lh>     |

### Vowels
Sarvaran features 7 basic vowels. This is essentially a 5 vowel system, with rounded /y/ and unrounded /ɯ/, as seen in the following (simplified) graph of Sarvaran vowels:

| **Vowels**   |               | **Front** | **Back**  |
| -------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
| **High** | **Unrounded** | i     | ɯ     |
|          | **Rounded**   | y     | u     |
| **Mid**  |               | e     | o     |
| **Low**  |               | a     | \[ɑ]* |
\* Allophone of /a/ before uvulars and back vowels

More precisely, Sarvaran can be said to contain 52 vowel phonemes, due to the many ways in which the vowels evolved over time, including the development of pitch accent, nasalisation, and diphthongisation.

### Phonotactics
The syllable structure of Sarvaran is (s)C(S)V(V/S)(C), and most roots are monosyllabic or disyllabic.
## Grammar
Sarvaran grammar is head-final, head-marking, polysynthetic, featuring a unique, gender-like pronoun system, and incorporation of the direct object. Sarvaran also lacks the definite article.
### Pronouns
In sarvaran, pronouns almost never appear alone, they are always accompanied by a head, to which they depend or modify. They are attached onto adpositions, verbs, and possessed nouns.

| **Pronouns**  | **Singular** | **Plural** | **No Number** |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| `1`           | san- / są-  | ey(a)-     |               |
| `2`           | n(i)-        | ul-        |               |
| `3` / `3.OTH` |              |            | m(u)-         |
| `3.ANML`      |              |            | ell(a)-       |
| `3.PLNT`      |              |            | yon- / yǫ-   |
| `3.DEI`       |              |            | l(i)-         |
Pronouns feature 4 gender-like versions of the 3rd person pronoun, which lack number, unlike the 1st and 2nd person pronouns. The pronoun `3` (3rd person other) is mostly used for people and abstract concepts, but refers to anything within the 3rd person. The pronoun `3.ANML` refers to animals and animate natural processes, such as rivers or weather. The pronoun `3.PLNT` refers to plants and inanimate objects, such as buildings or geological formations. The pronoun `3.DEI` refers to deities and celestial beings, such as watchstones, the Angels, and the Judges.
### Possession
Possessive phrases in Sarvaran are achieved by attaching the pronominal prefix of the possessor onto the possessed noun and optionally including the possessor noun before the possessed.

Heads do not include the pronominal agreement affix in the 3rd person singular other form. Only including it in situations where there is either no nominal subject, or to classify the dependent as referring to a concept previously mentioned. For example:

> [!quote] Example
> san-isyar-uqella-qa
> `1-companion-animal-PAU`
> 'Some of my pets'

> [!quote] Example
> n-aluq-ith widrilh qelh mu-san-olwanay-u.
> `2-dream-PL terrify_STV and 3-1-upset-PST`
> 'Your dreams are terrifying and they scare me.'

> [!quote] Example
> abiyǫ yon-owir-ith
> `tree 3.PLNT-leaf-PL`
> 'A tree's leaves'
### Adpositions
Similarly to genitive phrases, adpositional phases also feature the adposition succeeding the noun they modify, and agreeing with the noun's gender with a pronominal prefix.
> [!quote] Example
> dwarq-ith yǫ-sï
> `branch-PL 3.PLNT-on`
> 'On the branches'

> [!quote] Example
> ni-qelh
> `2-with`
> 'With you'
### Verbs
Verbs are the most morphologically dense aspect of Sarvaran, featuring polypersonal agreement, noun incorporation, many tenses, aspects, and moods, and the inclusion of adverbial morphemes.

| Subject Pronoun | Direct Object Pronoun / Incorporated Noun Stem | Indirect Object Pronoun | Negative Particle | Adverb Stem | Verb Stem | Tense | Aspect | Mood |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
> [!quote] Example

> [!quote] Example
> ul-sarqïtwarą-yürą-wa qassudh eya-mu-feyų-wa-s sï
