Sarvaran `Sarvaran: /sɑˈʋɑ́.ɾa/` was spoken in 6,500YA[^1] in the [Sarvaran Civilisation](cultures/morellic/sarvara/sarvara.md) by [Minikin](fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md). It descended from [Proto-Morellic](languages/morellic/proto-morellic.md) and so is part of the [Morellic Language Family](languages/morellic/morellic-family.md).
