## Overview

## Introduction

## Phonology
### Phonotactics
#### Syllable Structure
Proto-Central syllable structure is defined by a CCVC structure. More specifically, it has a C(S)V(N) structure, where S stands for any continuant and N stands for any nasal, any lateral, `/i̯/`, or `/u̯/`.
#### Nasal-Consonant Clusters
When in coda position, nasals must agree in place with the following consonant. It is apt to describe medial nasal codas as a moraic nasal phoneme (`/N/`), as they can have any place of articulation when in word-final or syllable-onset position.
### Stress
Syllable stress in Proto-Central was that every other syllable preceding the last heavy syllable (syllable with a coda) would be stressed. Early Proto-Central was stress-accented, but later dialects such as the Morellic dialect proved to be pitch-accented. When a word features no heavy syllables, the final syllable is stressed. Syllables with a schwa-nucleus can't be stressed.
### Consonants
|             |           | Labial  | Coronal    | Dorsal   |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| Plosive     | Plain     | p       | t          | k        |
|             | Voiced    | b       | d          | g        |
|             | Breathy   | bʱ (bh) | dʱ (dh)    | gʱ (gh)  |
| Fricative   | Voiceless | f       | s          | x (h)    |
|             | Voiced    | v (v)   | z (z)      | ɣ (y)    |
| Lateral     | Plain     |         | l          |          |
|             | Breathy   |         | lʱ (lh)    |          |
| Nasal       | Plain     | m       | n          | ŋ (ng)   |
|             | Breathy   | mʱ (m)  | nʱ (nh)    | ŋʱ (ngh) |

Proto-Central has 22 phonemes. It has 9 plosive phonemes, 6 fricatives, 2 laterals, and 6 nasals. It has a phonetic /h/ phone, which is inserted to illegalise vowel hiatus and make sure a words cannot begin with a vowel; it serves to reinforce the mandatory consonant at the beginning of a syllable.
#### Plosives
The plosives of Proto-Central have three voices, plain, voiced, and breathy.

The plain plosives are pronounced like the p, t, and k of words such as 's**p**ot' or 'mo**p**', 's**t**and' or 'gna**t**,' and 's**k**id' or 'pi**ck**.' They are romanized `/p/` \<p\>, `/t/` \<t\>, and `/k/` \<k\>.

The voiced plosives are pronounced in the same way, but with the vocal cords vibrating while they are produced. they are pronounced like the b, d, and g of words such as '**b**ad,' '**d**en,' or '**g**rey.' They are romanized `/b/` \<b\>, `/d/ `\<d\>, and `/g/` \<g\>.

The breathy plosives are trickier, they are pronounced like voiced plosives, but with the vocal cords allowing more air to pass through them. This gives them a breathy quality. They are romanized `/bʱ/` \<bh\>, `/dʱ/` \<dh\>, and `/gʱ/` \<gh\>. In the [Morellic](lore/groups/morellic-tribe) dialect, they are pronounced `/v/`, `/ð/`, and `/j/`, like the v, th and y of words such as '**v**ent', '**th**at', and '**y**ou.'
#### Fricatives
The voices of Proto-Central fricatives are voiceless and voiced.

The voiceless fricatives are pronounced like the f, s, and ch of words such as '**f**ind', '**s**and', and 'lo**ch**.' They are romanized `/f/` \<f\>, `/s/` \<s\>, `/x/` \<h\>.

The voiced fricatives are pronounced like the v, z, and gh of words such as '**v**andal', '**z**ig**z**ag', and 'u**gh**.' They are romanized `/v/` \<v\>, `/z/` \<z\>, `/ɣ/` \<gh\>. In the [Morellic](lore/groups/morellic-tribe) dialect, they are pronounced `/w/`, `/r/,` and `/j/`, like the w, r, and y of words such as '**w**ish', '**r**andom', and '**y**ard.'
#### Laterals and Nasals
The voices of Proto-Central nasals and laterals are plain and breathy.

The plain laterals and nasals are pronounced like the n, m, ng, and l of words such as 'va**n**,' '**m**ouse,' 'si**ng**,' and '**l**and.' They are romanized `/n/` \<n\>, `/m/` \<m\>, `/ŋ/` \<ng\>, `/l/` \<l\>.

The breathy nasals and laterals are pronounced similar to the breathy plosives, in the same way as their plain counterparts but with more air let through the vocal cords. They are romanized `/nʱ/` \<nh\>, `/mʱ/` \<mh\>, `/ŋʱ/` \<ngh\>, `/lʱ/` \<lh\>.
### Vowels
|        | Front | Central | Back |
|--------|-------|---------|------|
| High   | i     |         | u    |
| Mid    | e     | ə (ë)   | o    |
| Low    |       | ä (a)   |      |

Proto-Central has 6 vowel phonemes, a five-vowel system (`/a/`, `/e/`, `/i/`, `/o/`, and `/u/`) plus schwa (`/ə/`), the vowel in '**a**bout,' or 'b**y**thol.'
## Morphology

### Derivation
#### Nominalisation
Proto-Central nominalisation takes three forms, and all of them only apply to verbs.
### \*sa
#### Pronunciation
Early Proto-Central: `/sa/`
#### Etymology
Contraction of '\*sayamu'
#### Particle
1. Agent nominaliser
##### Patient Nominalisation
Patient nominalisation is like agent nominalisation, but the other way around. It gets 'doee' noun from a verb. I.e. employ > employee, train > trainee, etc.

In Proto-Central, there is no patient nominaliser. Rather, the verb stem can be used as a noun, as the patient nominaliser is unmarked.
##### Action Nominalisation
Action nominalisation is the term for when you refer to what a verb does. I.e. verbal nouns in welsh, know > knowledge, act > action, etc.

In Proto-Central, the action nominaliser is formed with the particle '-**zon**,' a contraction of '**\*ughezon**,' meaning 'do, make'
#### Person
Proto-Central has 6 persons;
1. 1st person, I, me,
2. 2nd person, you,
3. 3rd person minikin, he, she, they,
4. 3rd person animal,
5. 3rd person plant,
6. 3rd person deity.
The 1st person is marked with '\*ësa,' the 2nd '\*dho,' the Minikin 3rd '\*mu,' the animal 3rd '\*elya,' the plant 3rd '\*api,' and the deity 3rd '\*eli.'
#### Nouns
Nouns in Proto-Central are relatively unchanged from position-to-position, but do have to be inflected for possession and number. The possession agreement particle precedes the root, and the number particle succeeds the root.
##### Number
Nouns have 3 numbers;
1. Singular,
2. Paucal,
3. Plural.
The singular is unmarked, the paucal is marked with '\*aki,' and the plural is marked with '\*itu.'

Singular forms are the lemma forms and refer to one unit of the noun. Paucal forms refer to a few of the noun, such as a handful, but not a collective amount. Plural forms are used to refer to many of the noun, the collective concept of the noun, or simply a large non-singular amount.
#### Verbs
Verbs in Proto-Central carry the bulk of the meaning in a sentence. They agree in person and number for the subject and all objects, and also have a complex tense, aspect, mood system in combination with a set of auxiliaries.
##### Tense
Proto-Central verbs have 3 tenses;
1. Past
2. Present
3. Future
The past tense is marked with '\*avë,' the present is unmarked, and the future tense is marked with '\*ya.'
##### Aspect
Proto-Central has 3 aspects;
1. Progressive
2. Simple
3. Stative
The progressive aspect is marked with '\*so,' the simple is unmarked, and the stative aspect is marked with '\*il.'
##### Mood
Proto-Central has 3 moods;
1. Indicative
2. Subjunctive
3. Imperative
The indicative is unmarked, but the subjunctive is marked with '\*ngu' and the imperative is marked with '\*dul.'
##### Auxiliaries
Proto-Central has a few auxiliaries. For example;
1. 'have,' the perfect aspect
2. 'could,' the conditional mood
3. 'do, make,' the interrogative mood
4. 'see,' the witness evidential
5. 'hear,' the hearsay evidential
6. 'say,' the quotative evidental

Auxiliaries are formed with an inflected auxiliary and a preceding '\*zën' nominalised verb.
## Syntax
### Word Order
Proto-Central word order is largely head-final. It has;
- SOV word order
- Noun-Postposition
- Noun-Determiner
- Possessor-Possessee
### Personal Agreement
Heads have to agree in person with their dependents. I.e. 'the man's dog' > 'The man his-dog,' 'the sheep ate the bush' > 'the sheep the bush animal-plant-ate,' etc.
