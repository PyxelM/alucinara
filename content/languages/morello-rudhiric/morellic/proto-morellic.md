### Verbs
Verbs in Proto-Morellic were declined for whether the action was volitional or not.

For example, **Sneezing** would be non-volitional, and would take the `-ve` suffix unless it was done on purpose (somehow.)

In addition, Proto-Morellic also had 3 tenses, Non-past, Past, and Distant Past, which  was also used as a Gnomic tense in some cases.

It also had 4 aspects, Imperfect, Perfect, Progressive, and Prospective, for whether an action isn't completed, is completed, is progressing, and whether it is going to happen.

Volitional    |Non-past|Past     |Distant Past
--------------|--------|---------|------------
Imperfect     |-du     |fa-du    |si-du
Perfect       |-dura   |fa-dura  |si-dura
Progressive   |-dune   |fa-dune  |si-dune
Prospective   |-duzu   |fa-duzu  |si-duzu

Non-volitional|Non-past|Past     |Distant Past
--------------|--------|---------|------------
Imperfect     |-ve     |fa-ve    |si-ve
Perfect       |-vera   |fa-vera  |si-vera

## Origins of Grammar
### Verbs
#### Volitional suffix:
The volitional verb suffix, `/-du/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əduʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/ədu/` "to be sure of one's self" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Nonvolitional suffix
The nonvolitional verb suffix, `/-vɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əhvɛʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əhv/` "to be lost or confused" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Perfect suffix
The perfect verb suffix, `/-rä/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/räʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/rä/` "to complete" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Progressive suffix
The progressive verb suffix, `/-nɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/nəʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/nə/` "to move, be active" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Prospective suffix
The prospective verb suffix, `/-zu/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əzuʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əzu/` "to want, to wish" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Past prefix
The past verb prefix, `/fä-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əfɐh/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning "there"

#### Disant past prefix
The distant past verb prefix, `/si-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/ʍsih/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning "another age"

#### Proto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/
Proto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/ itself was derived form the root `/hɛʍ/`, meaning "like, similar", but was almost entirely lost in Proto-Morellic.
