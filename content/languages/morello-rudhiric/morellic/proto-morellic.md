Proto-Morellic `Proto-Morellic: /s̠äˈbʱä.z̠ɛç̠/` was spoken in 7,000YA, by the Cervina-Rohitan [Minikin](fauna/2nd%20realm/minikin/minikin.md).

*It is documented in all its detail [here](https://conworkshop.com/view_language.php?l=RVR).*

## Timeline
### 7,000YA
7,000YA was when it first began being spoken as what we would consider as Proto-Morellic.

### 6,500YA
It was by 6,500YA that Proto-Morellic had diverged into [Sarvaran](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md), Krvatri[^1], and Avanekh[^2], among [others](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/morellic-languages.md).

### Verbs
Verbs in Proto-Morellic were declined for whether the action was volitional or not.

For example, **Sneezing** would be non-volitional, and would take the `-ve` suffix unless it was done on purpose (somehow.)

In addition, Proto-Morellic also had 3 tenses, Non-past, Past, and Distant Past, which  was also used as a Gnomic tense in some cases.

It also had 4 aspects, Imperfect, Perfect, Progressive, and Prospective, for whether an action isn't completed, is completed, is progressing, and whether it is going to happen.

Volitional    |Non-past|Past     |Distant Past
--------------|--------|---------|------------
Imperfect     |-du     |fa-du    |si-du
Perfect       |-dura   |fa-dura  |si-dura
Progressive   |-dune   |fa-dune  |si-dune
Prospective   |-duzu   |fa-duzu  |si-duzu

Non-volitional|Non-past|Past     |Distant Past
--------------|--------|---------|------------
Imperfect     |-ve     |fa-ve    |si-ve
Perfect       |-vera   |fa-vera  |si-vera
Progressive   |-vene   |fa-vene  |si-vene
Prospective   |-vezu   |fa-vezu  |si-vezu

### Copula
The copula in Proto-Morellic was **Nedu**, but eventually two more words, **Seltadu** and **Aghidu**, would fuse together and become part of its conjugation by the speaking of [Stonechild Imperial](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/stonechild-imperial/stonechild-imperial.md).

#### Be
Proto-Morellic: *Nedu* `/ˈnɛ.du/`

Sarvaran: *Lédwo* `/ˈlé.dʷɔ/`

Stonechild Imperial: *Lép* `/ˈlép/`

#### Stand
Proto-Morellic: *Seltadu* `/s̠ɛɫˈtä.du/`

Sarvaran: *Salhtádwo* `/saɬˈtá.dʷɔ/`

Stonechild Imperial: *Satlháp* `/saˈt͡ɬáp/`

#### Appear
Proto-Morellic: *Aghidu* `/äˈgʱi.du/`

Sarvaran: *Ezhídwo* `/eˈʒí.dʷɔ/`

Stonechild Imperial: *Ezhíp* `/eˈʒíp/`

### What, When, Why, How
#### What
*What* and *Who* are interrogative pronouns used in place of an actor in a sentence in which said actor isn't known.

In Proto-Morellic, these unknown actors are represented by the Pronoun *"Kiavi" /kjä.vi/* with no animacy distinction as in English.

#### When
*When* is used as an interrogative adverb meaning "During what time?"

In Proto-Morellic, *When* is achieved through the adverb *"saiim" /sä.jim/*.

#### Why
*Why* is an interrogative adverb meaning "caused by what?"

In Proto-Morellic, *Why* is achieved through the word *"Kiavur?" /kjä.vur/* meaning "for what / who;" the dative form of previously mentioned *Kiavi*.

#### How
*How* is an interrogative adverb meaning "in what manner / way?"

In Proto-Morellic, *how* is achieved through the noun phrase *"kiavur ren? /kjä.vur rɛn/* meaning "in / at what?"

#### "Owen is eating parsnips in the rain"

> Uhkidune Oueni duombaset euslaur ren.

## Origins of Grammar
### Verbs
#### Volitional suffix:
The volitional verb suffix, `/-du/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əduʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/ədu/` "to be sure of one's self" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Nonvolitional suffix
The nonvolitional verb suffix, `/-vɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əhvɛʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əhv/` "to be lost or confused" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Perfect suffix
The perfect verb suffix, `/-rä/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/räʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/rä/` "to complete" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Progressive suffix
The progressive verb suffix, `/-nɛ/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/nəʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/nə/` "to move, be active" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Prospective suffix
The prospective verb suffix, `/-zu/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əzuʍ/`,  a dimorphemic word of `/əzu/` "to want, to wish" and`/-(ɛ)ʍ/` "-ly / converbialiser"

#### Past prefix
The past verb prefix, `/fä-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/əfɐh/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning "there"

#### Disant past prefix
The distant past verb prefix, `/si-/`, derived from the [Proto-Morello-Rudhiric](languages/morello-rudhiric/proto-morello-rudhiric.md) root `/ʍsih/`,  a monomorphemic pre-verbal particle meaning "another age"

#### Proto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/
Proto-Morello-Rudhiric /-ɛʍ/ itself was derived form the root `/hɛʍ/`, meaning "like, similar", but was almost entirely lost in Proto-Morellic.
