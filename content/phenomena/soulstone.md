## Overview
Soulstones are objects made of asphalt which are used to contain souls after death. They are a common funerary keepsake in many cultures, and are often carved into shapes relevant to the life of whose soul they contain.
## Uses
Soulstones are commonly used as memorial decorations, but also have use in containing the memories of the departed. [Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) can be used to access and recall these memories, resulting in their reenaction in the form of apparitions of light or particulate matter.
