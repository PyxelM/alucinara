## Overview
Generally, sky islands are large animal-shaped islands which float above the surface of the ground. They often feature self-sustaining ecosystems atop them, with a forest or grassland on the topside, and a rocky underside which changes shape due to [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) influence.

## Appearance
### Topside
The topside of sky islands can vary in appearance, but appear rocky like the underside and dusty without outside influence. However, over time or if the island comes from an organic area, nature and claim the topside of sky islands and forests or grasslands can grow on top.

### Underside
The underside of sky islands varies from the topside, commonly featuring only as a rocky surface. If a sky island is claimed by a sapient organism, the underside may be carved into and made to feature walkways or rooms carved into the rockface. However, when the surface is undisturbed, the alucinarium content causes the rock to warp or shift into shapes.

## Formation
Sky islands begin as subterranean alucinarium deposits near the ground surface. The alucinarium eventually may cause the surrounding area to detach from the crust and begin to float.

The alucinarium content in the rock causes the surface of sky islands to change shape, warping into features such as a face, a carving of a scene, or other small-scale features. In addition, larger-scale features can develop, such as the overall shape of the sky island to warp into the body plan of an animal.

Furthermore, sky islands show a tendancy to take the form animals according to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md). As sky islands float, they may take the form of avian animals such as birds or bats, or may take the form of aquatic animals such as whales or fish.

## Feeding Habits
While sky islands aren't alive, they need to be fed with alucinara energy to stay afloat, and hunt alucinariferous animals or plants to refuel according to the pseudo-fauna principle.

A common hunting practice is that the sky islands may be drawn to areas of high-alucinarium content, such as communities of animals or crystalline mountains. They swoop from high altitude  down, and catch any sources of alucinara in their mouths which shift open as they descend.

If an animal is eaten, then the alucinarium present in their body will be absorbed into the rock as decomposition takes place. Once all that is left is bone, the bone will be naturally moved deeper into the rock itself as the stone shifts. This can cause high concentrations of calcium in the rock, and this can cause vast large stalagtites of calcium carbonate to form.

## Stalagtites
These stalagtites hang from the underside of the sky islands, reaching large sizes. Due to the pseudo-fauna principle, these stalagtites may even warp vaguely into a shape reminiscent of a minikin, an other animal, or trees.

### Spikefalls
Once the stalagtites reach a large enough size, they can fall from the sky islands in an event known as a Spikefall. Due to their large mass, wide, dusty, vast craters form once they reach the ground. While a lot of the stalagtite is vapourised on impact, the large scale of them can lead to the more stable inner rock staying intact.

The more stable rock tends to take a more clarified shape of what the stalagtites were before impact. Whereas a minikinoid stalagtite may have a smooth indistinct surface on the sky island itself, once fallen the exess is broken away and there is left colossal structures at the centre of each crater.

### Stalagtite Communities
If found, some craters are converted into communities, cities, or towns. The central structure is commonly the basis of a deity, and these fallen stalagtites are often worshipped by those who live around them.

In addition, some crater communities carve houses or structures into the fallen stalagtites, creating walkways through the stone and balconies at the side, while others create wooden or clay buildings around the main structure. Some communities do both, and create walkways and/or connections from the carved structures into the external ones.

### Notable Stalagtite Communities
- [Cratertown](locations/cratertown.md), a town inhabited by [Dwiri](cultures/dwiri.md) minikin, built around an indistinct-shaped stalagtite.
- [City of the Fallen One](locations/city-of-the-fallen-one.md), a religious site of the [Neth](cultures/neth.md) minikin, built around a minikinoid stalagtite.
- [Amanitaville](locations/amanitaville.md), the capital of [Morelland](locations/morelland.md), built around a mushroom-shaped stalagtite.
