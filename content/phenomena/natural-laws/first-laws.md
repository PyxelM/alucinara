## Overview
The first laws of nature were the rules which reality abided by preceding creation. They are not suited for the reality created under the [Second Laws of Physics](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md), evidenced by their use as a deterrent by organisms. The first laws are often used in place of the second post-creation due to [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md).

The first laws are characterised by lack of gravity and the common presence of uncommon states of matter, among other aspects.
