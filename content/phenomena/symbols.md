## Overview
Symbols are shapes or images through which [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) energy can be channeled for a specific effect. This is achieved as symbols emulate the beauty of the world pre-shattering.
## Appearance
Symbols can vary in appearance depending on the desired effect, but are often etched into stone, wood, dirt, sand, and flesh. Common symbols have a design similar to eyes, rain, seedlings, or a brain.
## Uses
They are commonly used to enchant a living being or object with increased health, knowledge, rain, fertility, and for the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md) to be able to see through them.

In addition, they can also be used to curse a living being or object. A symbol of a skull may result in premature death, and a symbol of a broken bone may result in injury.
## Examples
[Watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) are a phenomenon closely connected to symbols. They are pieces of rock with eye symbols etched into them; through their physical appearance they have the ability to walk and be seen through by the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md).

Furthermore, it can be argued that the physical deities are symbols themselves, and their worldly power is derived from the [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) energy that is channeled through their physical forms.
