## Overview
Cloud Gnats are animal-like apparitions made of [alucinariferous](phenomena/alucinara.md) dust. They commonly appear as small animals, standing upright with their abdomen tapering off into a wispy tail. They retain cohesion through the influence of alucinara energy, but diffuse once the energy is unable to sustain cohesion.

## Appearance
Cloud Gnats appear translucent, dusty, and purple. They take the form of animals due to the [pseudo-fauna principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle.md), with arms, a head, a torso, and a tail, and sometimes exhibit small dark-purple [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) crystals in the places of eyes, claws and/or teeth.

In addition to their dusty purple appearance, they also exhibit orange sparks of light from within and around their main body. In fact, some cloud gnats may feature round emissive bulbs from where their eyes would be in place of round alucinara crystals.

## Behaviour
While cloud gnats are not alive, they appear similar to animals and exhibit animalistic behaviour as per the pseudo-fauna principle. This causes cloud gnats' sense of self-preservation, as they will  attempt to retain alucinara energy.

Cloud gnats will attempt to attack living beings in order to replenish their energy, as per the pseudo-fauna principle. This can pose a considerable threat due to their sharp crystalline claws, which can cause lacerations and lead to infection, but they easily lose cohesion and don't pose a threat when wafted away.

## Lifespan
Cloud Gnats' lifespans can vary from under a second to days or weeks. Size is correlated with lifespan, as smaller cloud gnats will immediately lose cohesion and diffuse, and larger cloud gnats will collapse under their own weight.

A size of roughly 22 cm (from the top of one's head to the tip of their tail) is the most conducive for prolonged cohesion, and many cloud gnats are seen at this size.
