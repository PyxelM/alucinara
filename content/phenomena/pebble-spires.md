## Overview
Pebble Spires are a phenomenon caused when rocks interact with [Alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md). They are largely benign, but can pose danger when toppled. They are relatively rare, but can appear on riverbanks and shores in areas of high alucinarium concentration.

## Formation
When a pebble is exposed to enough Alucinara to be compelled to [shift frequency](phenomena/frequencial-shift.md), but not enough to swap realms, they will form into a pebble spire. They will stack atop one another in an attempt to physically reach the next realm over, despite the fact that this is impossible without an [Alucinara gateway](phenomena/alucinara-gateway.md), and can reach great lengths given enough time.

## Danger
Pebble Spires can pose a threat when they are toppled, as the pebbles suspended at great altitudes can fall to the floor and potentially hurt anyone underneath.
