## Overview
Alucinara, or Alucinara Energy, is a type of energy characterised by the alteration of natural processes which would act differently without its influence. Alucinara causes this by altering the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) to act in place of the ordinary [Second Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md).

## Appearance
Alucinara energy itself is accompanied by the creation of short-lived orange orbs and sparks nearby. Although it is colourless itself, it often appears as a purple aura - this is due to the purple-shifting of light that passes through its energy fields.

Alucinarium, the mineral in which the energy is stored, appears semi-translucent, dark purple, and shines orange, easily cleaving off into dust. Due to the alucinara energy that is stored and emitted from the mineral, it is often accompanied by the orbs, sparks, and purple aura.

## Effects
Alucinara causes effects such as;
- Levitation of objects or living beings, where the effects of gravity will be altered in direction or intensity.
- Frequencial Shift, where an object or living being will be transported into another realm. This is often accomplished by the presence of an [Alucinara Gateway](phenomena/aluicnara-gateway.mc).
- Emission of light, where an object will emit glowing sparks or orbs which dim over time;
- The [Pseudo Fauna Principle](phenomena/pseudo-fauna-principle), where inanimate objects will act like living animals;
- The Soul, where alucinara energy will interact with hydrocarbons in pitch or amino acids to create consciousness;
- Phantasmarrhoea, where a living animal will undergo the growth of alucinarium crystals on the skin and organs, hallucinations, delusion, psychosis, and involuntary frequencial shift.

### Influence on Biology
Alucinara's effect on biology is characterised by growth of unhealthy crystals on the body and utilisation of the unnatural properties of the energy.

Utilisation of Alucinara has been convergently evolved numerous times in the history of biology, with its basis in the development of the 'Fortuitary Gland' - a gland dedicated to the regulation of alucinarium purity and content in the blood. It often aids the capability of alucinara use;
- In sapient species, alucinara use has similarities to tool use, such as using alucinara to ignite fires, light areas, and manipulate objects.
- In less sapient species such as plants, fungus, and most animals (and to a lesser extent, sapient species), alucinara use is expressed as a biological process. For example, it can be employed in involuntary defence mechanisms, such as bursts of light, to stun predators, or creation of force fields, to push them away.
