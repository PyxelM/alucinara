## Overview
[Alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) gateways, shifts, and rifts are a phenomena characterised by the transferrence of matter and energy between two realms. **Gateways** are doors through which one can travel between two realms and can be created though magic spells. **Shifts** are spontaneous occurances triggered by increased alucinarium levels that cause matter to be transported to another, usually infra-essent, realm (often occuring as a symptom of [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md).) **Rifts** are large areas where two realms may join for a brief period of time, often occurring in wide, isolated and untouched areas.
