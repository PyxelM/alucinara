## Overview
The Mora were a late neolithic tribe of pastoralist-nomadic [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) native to the steppes of [Tseireph](locations/tseireph*.md) in the [2nd realm](locations/2nd-realm*.md), belonging to the [Morellic](factions/morellic*.md) culture. They had brown skin and were largely hairless with an eye colour ranging from emerald to hazel, lived in matriarchal communities, and spoke a language reconstructed as [Proto-Morellic](languages/proto-morellic.md).
## Societal Structure
The Mora lived in matriarchal communities, led by the matriarch - an elder woman who had usually proven herself in battle or a similar great feat, and been chosen by the consensus of her group. These communities were largely familial, with males leaving at maturity to marry into other communities.
### Gender Roles
Women were seen as an almost sacred class, the givers of life and nurturers of children, who conducted diplomacy, dedicated themselves to religion and theosophy, and wove fabric; whereas men were seen as a more vulgar class, who oversaw the practices of animal husbandry and hard labour.
## Lifestyle
The Mora were nomadic pastoralists of the steppe, traversing the grasslands with their herd. They mostly kept animals such as [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md) and [yurikhs](fauna/yurikhs.md), and hunted other animals such as [pringis](fauna/pringis.md) and [treemice](fauna/treemice.md), using their skill as adept dartsmen.
## Clothing and Appearance
The Mora generally wore clothes made of plant fiber (such as wild [lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) linen) and yurikh hide, wearing long, dress-like tunics of fabric, leather belts, and overcoats. The males would let their hair down into a jaw to shoulder length style, or tie it up into a bun, and females would shave their head bald as part of a cultural tradition.
