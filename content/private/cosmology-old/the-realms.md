## Overview
The realms are the planes of existence within which one can exist and manipulate matter, energy, and information. There are 8 realms; the 7 corporeal realms, and the Dreamscape. The realms were originally created in the Shattering - an event early in creation that resulted in the fracture of the original creation into the 7 corporeal realms upon the deaths of the [Judges](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-judges.md).
## The Dreamscape
The dreamscape is the incorporeal realm in which the [Angels](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) and the [Petrified Child](cosmology/deities/the-petrified-child.md) reside. It lacks physical form, and can be accessed through the use of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) energy to store and recall information, also forming the basis of consciousness and the [soul](cosmology-1/darkness.md).

The Dreamscape can be accessed with [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) through spellcasting, ritual hallucination, dreams, and prayer. In some religions, only spiritual leaders are permitted to access it purposefully, and prophets are known to recieve revelations through it.
## Cross-realm Travel
The Realms are impossible to cross without the influence of alucinara energy. In order to cross them, an [alucinara gateway](phenomena/gateways*.md) can be formed using a spell, allowing matter and energy to pass between two realms. In addition, space and matter can sometimes be shifted from one realm to another seemingly at random, caused by increased levels of alucinarium in the area. This can result in spontaneous shifting, especially in those afflicted with [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md), and alucinara [rifts](phenomena/gateways*.md#Rifts).
## The Realms
There are 7 corporeal realms. The amount of alucinara energy immanent to each realm differs, increasing with intensity as one travels further from the centre. The central 0th realm contains the least amount of alucinara energy and the 3rd and -3rd contain the most.

The terms [Ultra-essent](tags/ultra-essent-realms) and [Infra-essent](tags/infra-essent-realms) refer to the positioning of the realms. Within Sarvaran tradition, the Ultra-essent realms are placed higher, and the infra-essent realms lower, with height corresponding to the percieved impurity and purity of each realm.
### The 0th Realm
The 0th realm contains the least amount of alucinara energy, with only enough to support time and consciousness. This realm contains planets such as Earth, which was one of the only planets capable of supporting life within the realm. Within [Sarvaran](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md) tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of dark green.
### The 1st Realm
The 1st realm contains planets such as [Aandra](locations/aandra.md), which was the home of the sapient species of [Slugfolk](fauna/Slugfolk.md). Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of orange-yellow.
### The 2nd Realm
The 2nd realm contains planets such as [Kherelh](lore/2nd-realm/Kherelh.md), which was the home of the sapient species of [Minikin](fauna/minikin.md), which founded the civilisations of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md) and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md). Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour of light green.
### The 3rd Realm
The 3rd realm contains the most alucinara energy, alongside the -3rd. Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour red.
## The Infra-Essent Realms
### The -1st Realm
Within Sarvaran tradition, the -1st realm is associated with the colour of darkness.
### The -2st Realm
Within Sarvaran tradition, the -2nd realm is associated with the colour blue.
### The -3rd Realm
The -3rd realm contains the most alucinara energy, alongside the 3rd. It is home to many deadly species of plants and animals, and is the place many victims of [phantasmarrhoea](conditions/phantasmarrhoea.md) are shifted to, making it a highly dangerous place. Within Sarvaran tradition, this realm is associated with the colour purple.
