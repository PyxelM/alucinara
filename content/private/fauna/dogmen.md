## Overview
Dogmen are a species of sapient canids native to the [2nd-realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). They are semi-arboreal carnivores, closest related to the [Treewolves](private/fauna/treewolves.md), inhabiting the forests of the eastern continent. They are the second most populous race of the 2nd realm, second to [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), capable of civilisation, [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) use, and speech.
## Appearance
Dogmen can reach 45cm in height at maturity, from their feet to their heads. They are simultaneously dog-like and primate-like in appearance, having strong arms for brachiation. They are covered in a coat of dark fur which they use to keep warm.
## Behaviour
Dogmen are diurnal hunters, living in large communities. They are adept woodworkers, constructing their villages and structures out of wood. Similar to minikin, they utilise [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) to cook food and engage with celestial beings. Due to their diet, they don't farm crops, rather opting to hunt prey and fish for their food, which they store in cool, subterranean storage spaces.
## Diet
Dogmen are carnivores, consuming mainly animals such as rabbits, [wolfrats](fauna/wolfrats.md), [treemice](fauna/treemice.md), and [wildcats](fauna/wildcats.md). They are also known to kill and eat [minikin](fauna/minikin.md), but this is rare, as the two races are capable of co-existing.
