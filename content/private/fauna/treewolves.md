## Overview
Treewolves are a species of carnivorous canine native to the -1st and [2nd](lore/2nd-realm.md) realms. They are related to [direwolves](private/fauna/direwolves.md), but are smaller, more primate-like, and live a primarily arboreal lifestyle. They are native to the deepest areas of the forests and jungles of their respective realms.
## Appearance
Tree-wolves can reach a length of about 45cm from the base of the tail to the tip of the snout at maturity. They are covered with a warm coat of dark fur with light spots. Their paws are more hand-like, and their limbs stronger, allowing them to better traverse the canopy and manipulate objects, and have sharp nails.
## Behaviour
Treewolves are largely solitary, crepuscular hunters, emerging in the twilight to find prey. They stalk the canopy, jumping down on their unfortunate victims. Furthermore, they utilise [alucinara](cosmology/alucinara.md) to warp light around them, appearing either invisible or warped to appear as another animal or being. They have small litters of 1 to 2 children, which they protect until maturity, when they leave to hunt alone.
## Diet
Treewolves are carnivores, consuming a similar diet to their relatives, the direwolves. However, due to their overlapping distributions, they are much more likely to consume [minikin](fauna/minikin.md). They mainly seek out medium to small sized mammals and birds.
