## Overview
This note will be exploring the history of the Minikin, more generally of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md). This will be explaining the events that led up to the creation of the Morellic tribe, and the fall of the first empires and the politics of the first groups. I will be deciding the events of the first 100-200 years, beginning with the founding of Naíru.
-
In this note we will be describing the Austerkin groups, their interactions with the Morellic minikin, such as trade and diplomacy. In addition, we will also be describing animal domestication, with creatures based on earth creatures and other creatures original to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md).

## Notes
Work On:
- Explain the use of weasels, expand upon their use apart from being used as mounts (milk, fur, farming, etc.)
-
- Two more Austerkin groups
	- Working on Austerkin as a whole
- Trade and Diplomacy
- Animals domestication

Remember:
- Carsai starts a pandemic / plague later on in the story  and her condition becomes widespread in a moment of societal weakness
- Twins are treated differently, like a caste system.
- work on the trade between city states (next episode?)
- work on the native Austerkin pre-Móra riSéwi society (next episode?)
## Context
This begins in the [Naíruan Peninsula](locations/nairuan-peninsula.md), where the Oyhólıru dynasty rules over a city-state known as Naíru, one of the first city states to gain any real power. The Oyhólıru dynasty is matriarchal, spearheaded by a queen; the eldest daughter (or child) of the previous monarch.

The Móra riSéwi minikin are a northern nomadic tribe native to the central continent (north of the lakes), containing many separate groups and communities, connected by a single Móra riSéwi culture and shared respect. They travel from place to place, riding on the backs of domesticated Weasels, foraging for food, exploring, looking for treasure, and sleeping in leaf hammocks.

There is a diaspora of nomadic Móra riSéwi minikin living as a community in Naíru, who settled after the leader of their group fell ill and needed medical help in the city; the minikin haven't left since the leader was rendered bedridden there in a tree-shelter.
-
The Móra riSéwi minikin used to be nomadic, but settled in Naíru after their leader caught a strange plague. as this plague spread, one of the queens died, and her sister went mad and killed the Móra riSéwi leader, which triggered the petrified child to destroy a portion of the royal district with a baby meadow.

The Móra riSéwi minikin fled the city, migrating southeast across the Sarvaran gulf on rafts, and eventually settled in an area inhabited by Austerkin minikin. In an attempt to settle down and get some stability once more, they mingled with some of the natives and founded the city-state of Sarvara, becoming the Morellic minikin as they interbred with the new people they met.

Some of the natives disliked the newcomers, not bothering to learn their language and choosing to go to battle with them over the resources native to the land. One group of these, the most violent, was the Tsanyana minikin, but there were also two other groups, which interacted with the Morellic minikin in different ways.

In addition, the Morellic minikin had to take advantage of the new land they found themselves in, unfamiliar with the native animals and fauna, but eventually grew to domesticate an array of fauna and flora.
## Events
### Móra riSéwi minikin discover the Tree
One day in the early autumn, the Móra riSéwi leader Carsai was foraging for food with her group. They found a clearing in a forest, and discovered a lone tree in the centre, surrounded by tar pits and dead bushes, with a quaint footpath of stones leading to an island in the midst of the tar-swamp.

It was almost perfect, a footpath and island lit up by sunlight in the middle of a dark forest, and naturally the party came to the centre and discovered that the tree was hollow and thin; you could push you arm through the tree and it could come out of the other end without any resistance.

Nonetheless, the would go back to its original shape soon after being disturbed, it appeared as if its components lacked gravity and the only force of nature affecting it was the need to be in one piece. Carsai ripped the tree open however, and was exposed to the ancient dust and fumes within, which poured out like a solid cloud.

When the dust cleared and as Carsai held the tree open, her group grasped at the items within the trunk. The items within were shimmering, iridescent and gold, in the shape of acorns, loaves of bread, and small dead animals - none was decomposed, all was perfectly preserved and an instinct within the party told them that it was edible.

Once the group collected the items in baskets, and the tree closed up once more, they returned to their camp site and unloaded the goods into their hammocks and bags. Carsai was the first to eat the gold food, and almost immediately began coughing; the same fumes and dust that had poured out of the tree was pouring from her mouth and nose, and her eyes turned the same colour as the gas.

The group didn't know what to do, but only stood back in fear. Soon, however, Carsai seemingly went back to normal, and the group decided quickly to dump the items back into the tree. But by the time they returned to the island, the clearing was empty, no tar swamp, no tree, only grass and bushes. In fear they laid down their baskets onto the floor and left the gold food there, and fled immediately.

### Carsai falls ill
Soon after however, Carsai's condition became more and more unstable. She would break into fits of coughing out the fumes, but would soon go back to normal, just as when she first ate the gold food. Eventually, she was unable to lead effectively, and the group resigned themselves to Naíru for her to recover; Naíru had very good healthcare.

Eventually, after a period of a few months to a year, Carsai became bedridden, and was unable to leave her sleep den in the city. Soon after she entered the state, her compatriots developed her symptoms, and even the native Naíruans did.

### Ykutru and many die
Not long after the symptoms appeared in the populus, they died, turning hollow with a thin surface, their sorry bodies disappearing when no one was looking. Carsai didn't die, her strength as a leader was matched by her strength as a body, and she was hanging on by a thread, still encouraging her compatriots.

In addition, Ykutru also died; Ykutru was the twin sister of the co-regnant Ajun, they were the two deformed twin queens of the city at the time. Ajun was horrified; her city, her twin sister, all gone. Not only this, but also the magical implications.

Twins share one soul, but the [magic energy](phenomena/alucinara.md) contained within the soul is enough to fill two bodies. When one twin dies, the other is filled to overflowing with magic energy (enough for two people); most twins die when this happens, undergoing the [curse of phantasmarrhoea](phenomena/phantasmarrhoea.md), some some are strong enough to resist. Unfortunately, the side effects still include insanity, violent irritability, and sometimes partial phantasmarrhoea.

Ajun was now a husk of her former self, she lost almost everything, her mind, her sister, a portion of her population, but she still had her power - she still had the ability to order people to make things right. The almost immediately ordered the eradication of the sick, and feared for her own health - she resigned herself to only wearing layers upon layers of armours and fabrics to shield herself from the fumes, despite the fact she lived in the royal tree where any of the fumes would simply sink to the ground.

### Carsai dies
Eventually, Carsai did die, but not to the illness she contracted and the plague that caused all of the havoc. Ajun had heard the rumours of Carsai's 'guilt,' that she was Patient 0 and in her insnaity blamed her for every wrong thing. She left her royal tree to climb up Carsai's; Ajun killed her in cold blood, in front of the entire group.

Little did she know, the Móra riSéwi were a very spiritual tribe, and had knowledge of how to interface with deities, and there was one of many [watchstones](phenomena/symbols/watchstones.md) staring directly at the queen.

### The Petrified Child destroys Ajun
The petrified child, knowing immediately of the evil that had took place before one of its 'eyes,' made a bee line from its dwelling place to the city of Naíru. Ajun didn't stand a chance against the child's perfect judgement; she and her guards to tried to fend the child off were swiftly turned into baby sludge.

A baby meadow was formed from the evil and corruption, political and literal, of the royalty. The city finally fell, cast into chaos. Whosoever wasn't killed by Carsai's plague, was lost to the baby sludge, and those who were further away were either trampled or died in some other fashion in the chaos of people attempting to escape.

The Móra riSéwi minikin eventually managed to escape, with many causalities to the petrified child and to the plague already. Carsai's eldest daughter, Bjáura, was rendered queen immediately and, taking after her mother, led the group to safety with authority and confidence. They fled for the west, reaching the coast, and camped there with their nomadic skills and instincts until they had built enough boats and rafts out of sticks and vegetation to sail southwest across the Sarvaran gulf.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230809145007.png)

On the journey, many died of dehydration and starvation, but they rationed the food they had gathered near the coast and threw overboard anyone who showed a symptom; they were successful in eradicating the plague from their own population, and only had to hope it wouldn't show up where they were sailing.

### Founding of Sarvara
Once they reached land, on the south-eastern coast of the Sarvaran gulf, they founded the city of Sarvara; Bjáura was the first queen. There were native Austerkin minikin in the area, which responded in many ways to the newcomers. A lot took pity on them, noting their starving bodies and desperate (if incomprehensible and foreign-language) explanations of what had happened.

Some of the natives treated them well, feeding them and helping them, but some saw them as a threat and began to war with them. The natives who had treated the Móra riSéwi minikin well were let into their new city-state, given hospitality as they had given them.

![](Pasted%20image%2020230809144929.png)

#### Castes
Sarvara developed a caste system, with the 'Native' and the 'Móra riSéwi' castes emerging. As the two groups interbred, the castes were handed down matrilineally, but the genetic makeup of the two groups evened out as time went along, leading to the creation of the Sarvaran race, made up of a hybrid of the Móra riSéwi and Austerkin races. A new name was fashioned for the Sarvaran group, the *Morellic* minikin.

### The Tsañána Minikin
The warring natives, however, were ostracised, and had their tails cut off at the first chance by the Móra riSéwi military. They were noticeable for their retention of native Austerkin characteristics, namely hairiness and their native language. They stayed in their own city-states, treating the Morellic natives with suspicion and the non-native Morellic minikin with outright prejudice.

Their nation is to the south of Sarvara, and they are an Un Ntúğa tribe. Following the arrival of the Morellic minikin, they made their own name, to differentiate themselves from the newcomers, and dubbed themselves the 'Tsañána,' meaning 'true people,' as opposed to the Öpfádṛh or Morellic minikin.
### The Öpfádṛh Minikin
The Öpfádṛh minikin are an Austerkin tribe situated to the west of Sarvara, they are closely related to the Tsañána minikin, but don't share their warlike habits; they rather see the Morellic minikin as unimportant and generally tend to trade items within themselves, uninterested in interactions with other tribes.

Being related to the Tsañána minikin, they are similarly a part of the larger 'Un Ntúğa' group.
### The Un Ntúğa Minikin
'Un Ntúğa' Minikin is the title given to the family of Öpfádṛh and Tsañána minikin. Un Ntúğa wasn't a tribe by the time the Morellic minikin arrived, but rather a cladistic title given to both groups who share a common ancestry. However, it used to be a tribe before.

The late Un Ntúğa tribe was a very large tribe, spanning an area southwest and south of the Sarvaran gulf. They were so large in fact, that two subgroups began to form within them and diverge due to lack of interaction, despite sharing a similar culture.

The Öpfádṛh group existed to the west, and Tsañána the east; this tribal division was set in stone once the Morellic minikin arrived, as the Tsañána minikin grew angry and jealous of their use and abuse to the local resources, and even angrier at their sibling group for not caring.

Once the tribal division was laid, and the Tsañána became more and more warlike in a time of political unrest, they began to war with not only the Morellic minikin but also the Öpfádṛh, seeing their small cultural differences as evil and unnatural diversions from *true* tradition, that they weren't *true* people, like the Tsañána.
### The Kaśtai̋ra Minikin
The Kaśtaïra minikin are a Śutéäqṇ minikin tribe situated to the east of Sarvara. They used to be one with the native Morellic minikin, but naturally and uneventfully diverged as the cultural differences grew larger and the western Śutéäqṇ minikin became more and more interested in being incorporated into Morellic society.

The eastern Kaśtai̋ra were largely disinterested with joining the tribe due to their geographic distance and western-cultural disinterest, but they rather saw the Morellic minikin as a valuable friend, a 'sister in law' on a kind of national scale of sorts, and grew to have a healthy trade relationship with the new tribe.
### The Śutéäqṇ Minikin
Similar to the Un Ntúğa minikin, the Śutéäqṇ minikin is a late tribe and modern grouping of tribes; The Śutéäqṇ minikin contain the Kaśtai̋ra minikin as well as the Morellic minikin, in that the native portion of Morellic genetics is traced back to the Śutéäqṇ tribe.

The Kaśtai̋ra minikin split off from the native Morellic minikin a while before the non-native Morellic minikin arrived, in fact. They had grew to naturally split, the Kaśtai̋ra being to the east-most portion of the Śutéäqṇ territory and the native Morellic minikin being on the border with the former border of the Tsañána.

As the Móra riSéwi minikin arrived, the tribal division was reinforced with the western Śutéäqṇ minikin being subsumed into the Morellic tribe, and the Kaśtai̋ra tribe eventually became its own solid separate group following the development out of the Śutéäqṇ tribe.

## Morellic Trade Relationships
The Morellic Minikin, living in Sarvara and neighbouring villages, have a lot of their own resources and need a lot of foreign resources. For example, the Morellic minikin lack fair-weed plant fibre, lapis alucinarii, and wormpigs in the area they had settled; and all of these things are found in the areas inhabited by the Morellic peoples' neighbours.
### To the Tsañána
Trade with the Tsañána is almost non-existent through official means, and no Tsañána ruler in their right might would ever let the Morellic minikin trade with their subjects. However, there is a black market between the two groups, where trade is acceptable, encouraged, and illegal.

The Morellic minikin import lapis alucinarii from the Tsañána area, illegally buying it for great amounts for use in royal temples and high-class architecture, where money can be spent and appearances are valuable; lapis alucinarii is a beautiful mineral made of alucinarium with gold veins travelling through it; it is commonly used by the Morellic minikin in ornamentation and spiritual idols.

Trade *from* the Morellic minikin to the Tsañána minikin was quite different however; a lot of the resources that the Tsañána felt was stolen from them was largely stolen by the Tsañána armies, and not traded.
### To the Öpfádṛh
Trade with the Öpfádṛh was mainly for their animals, the ecosystem cultivated and helped by the Öpfádṛh was very fruitful and led to great wealth among the group. They export various livestock animals to the Morellic minikin, sending them wormpigs, quartz-mice (imported from the [-2nd Realm](locations/-2nd-realm.md)), and many other livestock animals that are non-native to the Sarvaran area.

The Morellic export to the Öpfádṛh things such as Silklet nests, silklet silk, and fabric. There is an abundance of silklets in Sarvara, which are domesticated, farmed, and sold to the west, leading to a vibrant Silklet husbandry industry within Sarvara.
### To the Kaśtai̋ra
The Kaśtai̋ra minikin export fair-weed plant fibre to the Morellic minikin; due to the different habitat afforded to the Kaśtai̋ra minikin, fair-weed grows a lot more abundantly and in a lot better quality compared to Sarvara and the surrounding area. Fair-weed fibre is woven into royal garments, appearing with a light-yellow colour when not dyed.

The Morellic minikin export to the Kaśtai̋ra animals such as Weasels. Weasels are used by the minikin of the area as cavalry, they are a common sight on the Morello-Tsañána battlefield. Weasels are essentially only native to the Morellic and Tsañána area.

The Morellic minikin farm and sell weasels to the Kaśtai̋ra among other groups at points, but the Tsañána are very stingy with their weasels and tend to train them only for battle and never allow themselves to lose even one valuable weasel. 

Even so, weasels are very expensive and the Morellic weasel farmers are very rich for their products, listing them for high prices due to their importance to the military and the great danger a minikin puts themselves in to train a weasel for domestic or military use.

## Animals of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md)
## Weasels
Weasels are essentially the same in the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md) as in the 0th, originating from the Supernova of 80MB, but since then have developed an extra pair of legs with the help of alucinarium and a greater ability to leap. They are domesticated by Minikin for use in battle, as they would usually hunt minikin.

Minikin, being smart, noticed this, and began to weaponise them against their neighbours, eventually training them and treating them as pets once the aggression was bred out of them by skilled pastoralists. Now, they are largely used as cavalry in the military.

One or two minikin soldiers will sit upon a weasel's back, supported by the 3rd pair of legs, and charge at the enemy, holding spears in their hands or using [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) to levitate daggers and sharp objects forward into the enemy, like a spear or arrow.

It is an iconic sight to see a soldier or two sitting upon a weasels back, with only a rug-like cloth separating the rider from its steed, with an array of levitating darts above the rider's head floating in an arc, ready to be shot forward in a burst of magic.

Soldiers will typically hold both hands out, facing upward, to direct the magic to the daggers, flicking their hand forward to signal the darts to fire. Soldiers undergo training to increase their Alucinarium Reserve, and to resist the effects of Phantasmarrhoea.
## Silklets
Silklets are a type of insect native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), more specifically to places such as the Morellic area. IN their larval stage, they take the form of relatively large grubs, wriggling and being fed by farmers in specialised shelters made out of clay under tree branches.

Before they become adults, they continually grow a fleece of silk, which is shaved by farmers and sold to weavers. Once they do become adults, a portion of them are set aside to mate by the farmers if they had an especially fruitful coat as a larva. The majority, however, are killed and fed to Wormpigs once they reach adulthood and no longer produce silk.

They appear as large dragonflies as adults, and appear as large featureless grubs as larvae.
## Wormpigs
Wormpigs are a species native to the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm.md), more specifically to places such as the Öpfádṛh area, related to the wormwolves of the -3rd. Unlike their vicious carnivorous cousins, wormpigs are rather very docile and mostly herbivorous, and were eventually domesticated by the minikin for their meat as a livestock animal.

It is a common sight to see a wormpig farm at the foot of a Minikin's tree, with the wormpigs grazing and being fed with food such as leaves and bark dropped by farmers from the branches.

Wormpigs are actually not one organism, but two, with a symbiote organism constituting the legs, essentially, and a worm-like host organism that sits atop the back of the symbiote, using its legs for movement and paying it back in nutrition and everything it needs to survive, with a strong organic adhesive connecting the two creatures and highly vascularised and permeable tissue allowing for diffusion of compounds between the organisms.
