# Demi-Slugs
I want demislugs to be small, stocky, creatures. They will be mollusks descended from earth slugs, and live in the 1st realm.

## Diet
Demi-Slugs are largely herbivorous, and eat primarily leaves, berries, nuts, and bark. However, when desparate, they will definitely turn to small bugs, grubs, and worms for food. they abstain from eating mollusks as a cultural taboo.

## Culture
the demi slugs are not as zealous for the petrified child compared to the minikin, but will create watchstones. they don't believe in the petrified child, but have their own analogous deity which takes advantage of the same natural phenomena as the petrified child and watchstones.

## Clothing
I would like demislugs to have pointy potato-sack-like clothes made out of silk and leaves, they will also have an armour plate on their chests to cover their pneumostomes, usually made out of ivory, bone, or other hard materials. they will also have a symbol traced into them, perhaps the face of a watchstone or a symbol made to bless their health, luck, or harvest.

They tan leaves for use in clothing, taking the most hydrated leaves from trees for immediate use in tanneries, and eventually in clothing.

## Pastoralism
Demi slugs exhibit pastoralism in that they farm and herd a small marsupial animals known as the Silkmole.
### Silkmoles
Silkmoles are small marsupial creatures native to the 1st realm. they are fossorial, living in the ground, and grow silk for their coats in the winter.

They were eventually domesticated by the demislugs because they would dig their way into demi-slug colonies so much, and were eventually given their own rooms and enclosures where they could be fed and breed for teh benefit of both parties, the moles and the slugs.

## Clothing
due to the silkmoles' production of silk, the demislugs would often shave them during the winter or pick up their shed silk in the spring, and it eventually became evident that it would benefit the demi-slugs to weave the silk into thread that could be used for their clothing.

the demi-slugs initially kept their clothes together in one piece through the use of plant stems, tying leaf stems togeth er around their necks and waists; but eventually, they gained access to silk and weaving through the silkmoles. this revolutionised the clothing of demi-slugs, from what were merely brown leaf skirts and capes, became a host of clothijng items that the demi-slugs could use.

For example, they would now sew together tanned leaves with the silkmole thread, and hang their pneumostome armour over their chest with thick silken rope.

The heads of demi-slugs are covered with a piece of cloth with a hole cut out for the face, with the top edge left uncut as to allow for a flap to go over the face. the mouth is given enough room to eat effectively, and the eyestalks are given the slit as room to poke out of the clothing. The presence of cloth-to-skin contact maximises marmth, a valuable commodity when living a cold, damp, semi-sub-terranean lifestyle, which is fly the flap is needed.
## Religious Clothing
Demi-slug religious leaders don't wear the pneumostome armour, due to their unwavering trust in their gods. WHile it is not selfish to wear the armour, it is definitely seen as more humble and respectable to forsake such a vital piece of clothing.

Some religious leaders in higher positions don't wear clothing over the pneumostome at all, showing the most vulnerable part of their body on display, trusting the gods wholly not to curse them by getting it damaged.

## Natural Predators
The main predator of demi-slugs is the featherfly, an avian species originating in the 1st realm. Not abiding by earthen biology, they are a large insectoid species with an exoskeleton and a circular ray of feathers atop their back used to glide; [Alucinara](deities/alucinara.md) provides lift.

## Pantheon
### The Blind Mole
The Blind Mole is analogous to the Petrified Child of Morellic theology. Its cultural perception is influenced by the same deific phenomena that the petrified child is a part of, but doesn't serve as serious a role in the pantheon compared to in the morellic religion.

Influenced by the presence of moles in demi-slug society, the cultural perception of the petrified child shifted from recognising the stone swaddle as a swaddle toward being 

### The Divine Featherfly
In demi-slug religion, the divine featherfly is the main, and most important deity. influenced by early stories of the Second Judge of the Universe, the stories of creation were eventually remapped onto the physical visage of Featherflies, due to their salience and great ability to destroy.

The symbol used to interface with the divine featherfly is that of a featherfly standing atop the planet, and their use in iconography and in designs can bless a location, object, or person, to have greater luck in their endeavours. the use of the planet in the symbol is the feature that gives it power, and teh featherfly is only belueved to have an effect due to culture.

The symbol was given power when the second judge was destroyed and turned itself into goodness as a natural law; using the symbol increases the probability of goodness, essentially meaning that a featherfly symbol a good luck charm.
