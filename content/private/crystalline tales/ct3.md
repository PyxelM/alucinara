## Context
The Móra riSéwi minikin migrated southeast from the northwest of the sarvaran gulf following the plague in Naíru, started by their former leader Carsai. Carsai died and her eldest daughter Bjáura was appointed queen, just before the migration.

Once they reached land, they began to interact with the natives who all responded in different ways to their presence. the western Kaśtaïra were subsumed into the Móra riSéwi tribe, becoming the Morellic tribe as time went on. 
## Events
## The Móra riSéwi Minikin Arrive
The Móra riSéwi minikin arrived on the shore of the Sarvaran gulf, frantically running into the wilderness at the final sight of land. Then they met the local natives nearby, the western Kaśtaïra minikin, who gave them hospitality.

Running and screaming in a foreign language, the Móra riSéwi minikin were taken into the western Kaśtaïra trees, dens, and villages, set about fires and finally given a moment to relax, eat, and attempt to explain the situation in their indecipherable tongue.

### The Counsel of Móra riSéwi Refuge
As the situation became apparent, the matriarchs of the western Kaśtaïra clans all came together to discuss the matter. They accepted the Móra riSéwi minikin in on the condition that they would be cast out by the time they built their own villages, as not to burden their tribe with another group to feed.

In addition, the matriarchs also decreed that the Móra riSéwi minikin should be taught how to build cities, as their nomadic tradition only passed down the knowledge of building temporary bases, not built to last. In fact, it was the Kaśtaïra minikin who taught the Móra riSéwi how to build clay dens, by showing them how to find clay and store it in their cheeks.
## Interbreeding into the Morellic People
As the Móra riSéwi minikin settled down in the western Kaśtaïra villages, they naturally began to interbreed and intermarry into the native populations. Continually, every year or so, the matriarchs would convene once more to discuss the Móra riSéwi's progress, and asses whether it was time to drive them out.
### The Móra riSéwi Language
Knowing that they were to be driven out at some point, the matrilineally Móra riSéwi minikin retained knowledge of their language, and it wasn't subsumed by the native Kaśtaïra language although a lot of loanwords were gained.

### The Departure of the Móra riSéwi Minikin
Once the matriarchs decided it was time for the Móra riSéwi minikin to leave, they had ultimately kained their knowledge of how to found a city not through being taught but through interbreeding into the population; their ability was defined by the fact that they were now partially native to a society that *isn't* nomadic.

And once it was time to be driven out, there was no ostracism. A lot of people had the claim to stay, being (partially or completely) native, but a lot of Móra riSéwi minikin had so much respect for the matriarchs and for recent history that they did decide to leave and found their own city to preserve the Móra riSéwi legacy.

The ones to depart became the Morellic minikin, a cultural and genetic merge of the settlers and the native Kaśtaïra minikin, who gained their own more distinct cultural identity once they left and settled in Sarvara.

## The Search for Sarvara
When the Móra riSéwi minikin had arrived, they arrived close by to the great river Abhmýra. This river, situated in the midst of a very beautiful river valley, was talked about quite a lot once they had settled in the Kaśtaïra settlements. Of course, these stories were relayed to the migrators' children, and gained a semi-mythical status.

So of course, when it was time to leave, the new Morellic minikin left for the river valley. Having heard stories of the location first hand from their parents, uncorrupted by such a short time-span, they knew the way to get there and employed a lot of knowledge of the area as Kaśtaïra descendants to find it.

## The Founding of Sarvara
Eventually, they did. After a few months march across the wilderness, the matriarch of the Morellic minikin, Kallaśí daughter of Bjáura, found the Sarvaran river valley with her tribe. They named the settlement and the river 'Sarvara,' meaning 'Our River' in Old Morellic, referring to their inherent entitlement to the area as the ones who mythologised and found it.

The valley, very green, in a largely dry steppe, exhibited the sparkling blue colour of the very wide river with a large eyot in the centre; the eyot featured a large tree in the centre, the tree told in the stories. Knowing the river was very conducive for fertile soil, they almost immediately leaped upon the banks and collected clay for their tree-dens.

Kallaśí's servants, especially the Kaśtaïran architects, also immediately pounced upon the large tree at their queen's order and began to build dens, platforms, and rooms fit for royalty upon the tree's nooks and branches. The tree was adored with beautiful clay den architecture, gemstones, and magical implements to increase the awe that the royal tree (a palace, essentially) provided.
### Its Development
The development of Sarvara was greatly accelerated by the continual flooding of the Sarvara river. The minikin would build their supply dens in the trees, same with their sleeping dens, and packed clay down onto the upside of the branches to provide smooth walkways. They also added bridges, stairs, and magical floating stepping stones across the branches and trees through the air to increase accessibility.

They made a point not to build directly upon the floor where the flood could damage their stores, and only built their farms and sowed their crops within the reach of the flood. Preceding the flood season, they would sow their crops, and after the flood season they would harvest their crops once they grew to maturity.

#### Hibernation
In the winter, they would all store their yield, and have a large feat together as a tribe. Each tree would be lit up by magical candles as everybody sat down to eat with each other, and once the feast was over at midnight they would all resign themselves to their hibernatory dens and sleep all the way through to the pre-flood season.

## Sarvaran Oligarchy
As the city-state developed, it became clearer and clearer that such a centralised monarchical governmental system was not viable, especially as the city grew and more Morellic towns were being built nearby. So after a while, Kallaśí appointed an array of 8 oligarchs to rule over different portions of the city and surrounding areas. These oligarchs were all chosen from the most important and influential families, each being the matriarch of their respective house.

Essentially, these people were given a lot of control over their own district to enforce rules, imprison, and alter the way things work in their respective areas. Their subjects would pay taxes to them, ad half of the money would be given to Kallaśí the queen.

These oligarchs would convene at the royal tree with the queen, discussing matters such as crime, taxes, citizen loyalty, war with other tribes, among other things. In addition, they were also trained by Kallaśí to be proficient sorcerers; they gained great Alucinara-Endurance and a great knowledge of how to use [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) for their own purposes as people in power.

However, they all had their heads and all of their fur shaven. this was to show their loyalty to Sarvara, as Squirrels were worshipped and revered religiously in Morellic society, and fur was seen as a connection to their divine ancestors. It showed a great amount of loyalty to forsake one's connection to their religion in place of a show of commitment to their country, despite how embarrassing it may have seemed.
