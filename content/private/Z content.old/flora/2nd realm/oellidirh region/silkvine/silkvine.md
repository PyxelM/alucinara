Silkvine is a plant native to the [Central Continent](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/central-continent.md) of [2°e](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md).

## Silk
The Silkvine is named for the fact that the undersides of their leaves are the preferred shelter of Threadgrubs, one of the most accessible source of silk.

## Edibility
In addition, Silkvine flesh is edible, nutritious, and used as a food source by [Minikin](private/Z%20content.old/fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md). Silkvines are cut along their length into circular prisms known as "Vinechips."

Vinechips can be roasted, boiled, or eaten raw.
