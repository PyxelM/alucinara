Infra-essence and Ultra-essence are the names given to the phenomena of places, objects, and entities existing within the many [realms](private/Z%20content.old/alucinara/realms/realms.md) of [Alucinara](/_index.md).

## Terminology
**Ultra-essent** is the name given to phenomena of realms [0°e](private/Z%20content.old/locations/0th-realm.md) and above. Inversely, **Infra-essent** is the name given to phenomena of realms -1°e and below.

Infra-essent phenomena tend to be more dangerous than Ultra-essent phenomena, although this rule is merely a guideline and isn't wholly correct.

## Use
Realm-hopping (Formally referred to as [Essential Shift](alucinara/realms/essential-shift.md)) is the name given to the action of moving between realms. This is achieved through the use of an [Alucinara Gateway](private/Z%20content.old/alucinara/realms/gateway.md). Essential Shift is also a symptom of [Phantasmarrhoea](private/Z%20content.old/illnesses/phantasmarrhoea.md).
