Sheep, originally native to the [0th Realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/0th-realm.md), are caprines. Since their conception, they have spread to many infra-essent and ultra-essent realms, and diverged from their ancestors.

Every [2nd Realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md) Sheep are descended from [0th Realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/0th-realm.md) Mouflon.

## Morphology
Sheep of the [2nd Realm](private/Z%20content.old/locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md) differ from 0th Realm sheep in that they exhibit 6 legs.

Sheep males commonly exhibit Antlers, a feature taken advantage of in [Ram's Head Migration](private/Z%20content.old/cultures/morellic/rams-head-migration.md) of the [Morellic Culture](private/Z%20content.old/cultures/morellic/morellic-culture.md).
