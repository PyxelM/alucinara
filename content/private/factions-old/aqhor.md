## Overview
Aqhor was a [Morell0](private/factions-old/morellic*.md)-[Nethic](factions/nethic.md) city state and Bronze-age nation located at the delta of the river Sarav. The language of Aqhor was Aqhoran, a Southern Morellic language with prevalent Nethic substrate influence. Aqhor traces to the southern [Mora](private/factions-old/mora.md) communities, who settled into the delta which had been previously inhabited by a pre-Aqhoran Nethic tribe, which they assumed control over.

## Societal Structure
Aqhoran society was a melding of Morellic and Nethic culture, but retained an apartheid system from the nation's youth, made up of those who matrilineally inherited a Morellic or Nethic caste.
