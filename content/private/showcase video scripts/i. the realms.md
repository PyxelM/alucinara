## Part 0: Intro
Thousands of years ago, before wheat was first planted and bread first baked, there was two judges over the cosmos. The first Judge was named Ena, and the second Udru. They created the world, they created the angels to govern it, and they created magic.

Ultimately, Udru rebelled against Ena, creating life. Living beings were never meant to exist in that creation, and they hungered to consume the world they had been born into, or else they would die. Over the course of millenia, they destroyed the cosmos, and eventually made an attempt on the lives of the Judges.

In their dying moments, the Judges bound the living beings within bodies of flesh, and were ultimately destroyed. The energy of their perishing spirits was now released in an explosion that shattered the cosmos into 7 pieces.
## Part i: What Are the Realms?
There are 8 realms, the 7 corporeal realms that resulted from the shattering, and the 1 incorporeal realm known as the 'Dreamscape.' The realms are independent planes of existence, each containing their own cosmoi and differing levels of magic.

The realms are listed from -3rd to positive 3rd. The 0th realm, containing Earth, contains the least amount of magic compared to the -3rd and 3rd, which contain the most. The infra-essent realms, below the 0th, are traditionally darker, compared to the ultra-essent, which are traditionally lighter.
### Part iia: The Dreamscape and Alucinara
The dreamscape is the only incorporeal realm. It lacks a physical plane, but rather contains information. The angels, created by the Judges, and the Petrified Child reside within the dreamscape, although the Petrified Child is the only celestial being with a physical form.

The dreamscape can be accessed through magic, also known as Alucinara energy, which allows the dreamscape to affect the physical realms. This results in anomalous and supernatural phenomena, the effects of which can be controlled, and **are** controlled by plants, animals, sorcerers, and prophets.

Consciousness, thought, and memory all proceed from the Dreamscape, and so Alucinara energy is an essential part of the soul, alongside the energy of Darkness, which converts the information of the dreamscape into neural impulses.
