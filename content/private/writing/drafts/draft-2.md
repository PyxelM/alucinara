## Chapter 1

People are made for one another, to live and love in the company of those they care about. But in the midst of the undergrowth, someone was left. He was utterly alone. He wasn’t awake, but he was alive, his breath shallowly flaring into cold mist.

His eyes fluttered up as the sun came out from below the horizon, bathing the forest in golden sunlight that washed his body with light enough to wake all things this side of the world. His body weakly buckled as he got up, beginning to thirstily trudge onward. He needed help.

Some people need love, some need riches, but what he needed most was water. A fire, a home, a lover, all of this was irrelevant in the wake of the instinctual drive to survive that came over him like a wild animal.

His need was satisfied in part when he found a cluster of berries hidden amongst leaf-litter. He felt vitality return as he ate.

‘Enjoying those?’ A voice called out. The man jumped, looking around, but there was nobody there.

‘You think you can eat anything you find out here? Food is scarce. And judging by how you look, it seems you aren’t used to how this place works.’ The voice added.

‘What is this place?’ The man timidly responded.

‘You think I know? I just know things live here. Big, ugly people. And beasts. If we’re not safe, we could get eaten.’

‘What are you doing here then?

‘What are You doing here?’ It said, deflecting the inquiry.

The man paused. ‘Where are you anyway?’

‘Up.’ The voice quickly increased in volume as the word progressed. In a thud and a puff of leaves, the voice fell to the ground, coalescing into a figure as it now stood before the man.

‘What are you?’ The man exclaimed.

‘Toad Stool, son of Toad Petal, from Amanitaville.’ The figure declared. ‘You can call me Toadstool.’

‘No, What are you?’

‘Thought this might be a problem. I am a Minikin.’

The man stared at Toadstool as if he were inspecting a newborn. He had a bushy tail, but was hairless apart from it and a head of dark-green hair. His face was elongated into a whiskered snout and a large, wide nose, and his eyes differed to the man’s. The man’s eyes sat upon stalks, but Toadstool’s sat inside the sides of his face. His skin was also smooth.

‘Now, I know What you are, a Slugfolk, but I don’t know who you are.’ Toadstool declared.

‘I’m Aanurku jau Nghwaluu, son of Siiranlat jat Nghwaalut.’

‘What?’

‘That’s my name.’

‘I’ll just call you Blueberry.’ Toadstool conceded, pointing at what Blueberry had just eaten. ‘That’s what you get for eating my lunch. And where are you from?’

‘From…’

The forest silently awaited the conclusion to his response. Despite the patience of the trees, the birds chirped stubbornly alongside the distant, echoing drone of habitation.

‘Can you just get me out of here?’ Blueberry said; a response never came. ‘I need to find a place to live.’

‘It doesn’t matter. I know you’re from the place other Slugfolk are from, although I’ve never been. But yes, I’m better than other people out here–I’ll let you in. Follow me.’

Blueberry sighed cathartically when he heard this, beginning to follow Toadstool as he walked through the greenery. Blueberry looked around, taking in the environment. It was all new to him. He couldn't keep his eyes from the trinkets that dangled from Toadstool's bag.

‘So, what’s that?’ Blueberry asked, making conversation. ‘That golden ring on your back.’

‘An ornament.’

‘What do you have it for?

‘Décor.’

‘And that chain, those coins rattling around inside of your rucksack?’

‘...’

‘Why are you dodging the question?’

Toadstool turned around to face Blueberry. ‘None of your business. Just follow me, ask no questions, not until we’re under some shelter.’

Blueberry paused for a second as Toadstool took the initiative to turn forward once more. He stared at his back inquisitively.

The two walked through a thicket, coming upon a tunnel into the ground. It had been dug years ago, judging by the way the dirt had been packed over time, and was only just small enough for the two to pass through–a rabbit couldn’t even get inside without much struggle. The sunlight began to dim as they advanced further and deeper into the seemingly endless tunnel, which eventually widened.

The light began to grow once more. Happening upon a room, Blueberry was relieved to be in a place he could rest. There were straw beds elevated on the ground with which to sleep and a few wooden boards wedged into the earthen walls, all of which were adorned with candles which lit up the room in orange.

Toadstool pulled a rock over the entrance, setting his rucksack atop one of the boards, and sat on the edge of one of the beds.

‘So.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘What’s your story?’

‘Well. You know I’m a “Slugfolk.” What else is there to say?’

‘Come on. There’s more to you than your species, right?’

‘I, uh…’ Blueberry mumbled, stuttering. ‘Tell me why I should trust you first.’

‘Because I’m in control. Look at you–you’re wearing rags, your weak spot isn’t even covered… I saw you laying there in the brush; one well placed spear through your pneumostome and that would be it.’

‘Is that a threat?’

‘No, no… I’m just saying. I’m not the best guy, but I’m nice enough to help you out. Wronging you is unnecessary.’

‘But you didn’t answer my question.’ Toadstool added. ‘Something must have happened to get you here; tell me–why aren’t you off in some steppe from another world eating bark and salad?’

‘I don’t remember what caused it.’ Blueberry admitted. ‘But I did something. Because of it, my people began to hate me, and after a grassroots trial, they managed to force me out of my hometown.’ He laughed retrospectively. ‘In the end, I don’t even remember how or why, I woke up here once it was over.’

‘Not going to tell me what you did to make them hate you?’ Toadstool asked. ‘But that’s fine, everybody has their secrets.’

‘So what’s yours?’ Blueberry inquired.

‘Hm?’

‘Your story.’

Toadstool stared at the wall behind Blueberry. ‘I’m not someone to look up to. End-of.’

‘I’m not asking for your sins. Just, where are you from? What’s your background?’

‘Oh.’ He paused. ‘You know I’m from Amanitaville, like my name says. I have …8… brothers and sisters. I’m from the Clan of the Deer. I sell things.’

‘Like a merchant?’

‘Yes, you could say so. A merchant.’ Toadstool seemed happy with this conclusion. ‘I have family in Amanitaville; I could let you sleep in one of our shelters.’

‘That’s so kind of you!’ Blueberry exclaimed. ‘Thank you… but tell me… Are there people like me in Amanitaville?’

‘Slugfolk?’

‘Yep.’

‘There’s people there. I… don’t actually spend that much time there, I couldn’t say. But–by the sacred will of the Petrified Child–you’ll fit in. Probably.’

‘Petrified what now?’

‘It’s just an old saying. An old god.’

Blueberry shuffled in his seat uncomfortably. The truth set in; he was abandoned, alone, in a world of new gods, new species, and new worlds. He wondered if he would never be able to get used to the world outside of his hometown. He tried to take his mind off of it.

‘So, why did you bring me here, closed off underground?’ Blueberry asked. ‘Because clearly this isn’t Amanitaville. If it were, you’d be a mole rat.’ He jested.

‘Because it’s safe, and I need an enclosed place where I won’t be ambushed. I want to make sure you’re not a spy.’

‘A spy?’

Toadstool said nothing and walked over to Blueberry, unlacing the back of his tunic. He inspected the wet skin on the back of his neck. ‘No brand, you’re good. I believe your story, too.’

Blueberry scoffed. ‘Is this normal? Will I have to worry about spies running around?’

‘Only if you’re a “merchant” like me.’ Toadstool chuckled. ‘Let’s just say I have my enemies. Some people want what I sell, and aren’t willing to buy it from me.’

‘Never before have I wanted this much to go home again.’ Blueberry admitted. Toadstool re-tied the lace of Blueberry’s tunic, and stood up.

‘Now I know you’re safe, we’re good to go to Amanitaville.’

Blueberry nodded, and Toadstool picked up his rucksack. He pushed the rock at the entrance out of the way once more, and walking out through the cramped tunnel, they emerged at the surface. The sun shined white through the mid-morning autumnal fog.

Blueberry gasped as his companion took him by the hand, two flat, ethereal appendages appearing out of the mist behind the duo’s backs.

‘What are these?’ He asked, bracing himself.

Toadstool looked Blueberry in the eye for a second, pausing. ‘Wings.’

The two suddenly shot into the air, their wings turning purple, flapping with orange sparks. The fog dispersed as they shot above the surface of the ground, and soon they were both above the canopy. Blueberry could see the entire landscape. The sky, a distant lake, the forest that stretched from horizon to horizon.

‘You can fly?’ Blueberry asked.

‘You can too. Look at you.’ Toadstool unlatched his grip from his hand, and the two wings between them separated into four.

Blueberry was flying, certainly. He could see a purple powdery residue sticking to the hand that was being held, which flared orange and evaporated over time with a tingling sensation. Toadstool gripped his hand once more as the powder ran out and Blueberry lost his balance. The wings merged back into two.

‘This is terrifying.’ Blueberry rigidly uttered.

‘Just relax. We just need to reach the other side of that lake, there my magic will be more stable, and we’ll be able to enter a gateway to Amanitaville.’

Blueberry gulped, trying to control his breathing. The lake approached from the horizon, and as they crossed its shore from above, he felt a great calm take him.

‘Feeling more at ease?’ Toadstool asked. ‘It’s gotta be the scenery.’

Blueberry nervously laughed. ‘Yeah. I’m too used to dry shrubbery. Never seen this much water in one place apart from the oasis at my… home…’

‘Oh darn.’ Toadstool interjected. ‘Well don’t worry. There’s plenty of water over where I’m from. This is only a taster of what’s to come.’

Blueberry was silent.

‘So what did you do to make your people hate you, if you don’t mind my asking?’ Toadstool asked.

Blueberry stared down at the vast surface of the lake, he was on edge, yet calmed by the scenery at the same time. Like a clogged old dam, he couldn’t get the words out. They weren’t there. All memory of what he did to deserve his ostracism was void. His brain panicked, looking for an explanation, but every conclusion it came to felt like a half-baked lie.

‘I don’t-’ He paused. ‘I have no idea. It terrifies me to think about it. I’m scared thinking of what I could have done, and I’m utterly ashamed that I’m unable to feel guilty for it.’

Toadstool stared at him contemplatively.

Blueberry continued his monologue. ‘Thank you for your hospitality though. I wouldn’t know where to start in rebuilding a life for myself.’

‘It’s no problem.’ Toadstool responded. ‘I’m really sorry to hear about your situation.’

Blueberry nodded.

‘Stonechild knows some of us wish we could forget our sins.’ He mumbled, almost inaudibly. The sky fell silent apart from the whistle of air past their flight.

‘Lucky for us, our journey will soon be over.’ Toadstool pointed to a peninsula in the lake. ‘That place is stable. We’ll be able to go to Amanitaville there.’

Blueberry was relieved to be out of the air. Once they landed, he took a moment to breathe, reorienting himself, and took a drink from the lake.

‘Dizzy?’ Toadstool asked. ‘That’s normal for people new to the charm of levitation.’

‘Yep.’ Blueberry gagged into the water.

‘I’m just glad you had some prior exposure. You had to have used magic to get here, right? That’s how I knew it was safe. Normally, people native to this realm can't handle it.’

Blueberry frowned. ‘What happens to them?’

‘Stonechild…’ He sighed. ‘It’s horrid. I don’t want to say.’

‘That’s fine.’ Blueberry consoled.

Toadstool rubbed his hands together, his palms flaring in sparks. Soon, a large circle began to rip through the fabric of space, its circumference flickering in a spinning circle of orange and purple.

‘This, Blueberry, is how we can travel to my realm, where Amanitaville is.’

Blueberry’s face lit up in a turmeric hue. Staring into the gateway, he could feel something familiar, as if he’d seen one before. His stomach churned looking into the spinning hole.

‘It’s terrifying.’

‘It’s travel.’

Toadstool took Blueberry by the hand, marching into the portal. For a second, Blueberry thought he could see the whole world and 6 more, but in the blink of an eye it was forgotten. 

Once reality coalesced, the two were in a new realm.

## Chapter 2

‘Welcome to the 2nd Realm.’ Toadstool exclaimed.

This place was even stranger than the previous. The trees appeared yellow and red as if it were autumn all-year round, but the air felt as if it were summer. The sky stood pink above the ground, and the canopy was saturated with habitation.

Large, towering mushrooms littered the scenery, accompanying the trees in their stature. Some of the mushrooms looked like morels, some like agarics, others like boletes and, rarely, like ink-caps.

Stepping stones floated in the air, connecting the pathways made of packed clay on the upside of each branch, which ended in dangling shelters that contained beds and stored food and items.

Other people, Minikin just like Toadstool, stood on the branches and on the floor. Some of them on the branches had ropes that held baskets on the end, which others on the ground placed supplies into. The majority, however, opted to transport supplies with the same magic that Toadstool had used earlier.

‘This is Amanitaville?’ Blueberry asked, shaken.

‘That’s right; we were in the 0th Realm before. You likely came from the 1st if you’re one of the Slugfolk.’ Toadstool explained. ‘Thankfully, you won’t have to keep track of all this, given you don’t leave for another realm.’

The gateway closing behind them, the two walked along the gravel paths built into the ground, Blueberry following Toadstool’s direction.

‘My family’s home is north-west of here.’ Toadstool said, pointing in the direction.

Blueberry felt uneasy. He felt as if the people they walked past were staring, at Toadstool or at himself–maybe at both of them.

The stares advanced into jeers and growls. It became clear to Blueberry, in a confusing, almost relieving way, that he wasn’t being addressed–it was Toadstool. Blueberry’s eyes darted concernedly from the hecklers to his companion.

‘Thief!’ One voice shouted.

Toadstool kept quiet, but it was clear he was thinking.

‘Not looking to buy what you have to sell, careless freak!’ Another shouted.

‘Careless freak?’ Blueberry asked.

‘I told you. I’m not someone to look up to.’

Blueberry held a concerned look at Toadstool.

‘Murderer!’ Someone exclaimed.

‘Murderer?’ Blueberry yelped, stopping in his tracks. Toadstool walked onward, disregarding Blueberry’s repetition of the jeer as if he were to have meant it like everybody else.

Halting after a moment, Toadstool spoke. ‘It’s more complicated than they put on. I’m not a killer, I’m not a murderer–I never laid my hands on anybody.’

‘Explain yourself.’

‘I…’ Toadstool stuttered. ‘I can’t.’

He continued. ‘But if I were what they said, I wouldn't be helping you. I wouldn’t be doing something good.’

Blueberry said nothing.

‘I’m sorry you have to be here for it.’ Toadstool apologised. ‘Normally they don’t shout like that, but I think they’re just trying to ward you off, to get you away from the “me” they have in their minds.’

Blueberry remained silent, and continued onward.

Arriving at the foot of Toadstool’s home tree, Blueberry couldn’t help but stand in awe at the size of it–not only was it very large, but it also bore large morel mushrooms which had been hollowed and converted into living areas.

‘Are you any good at climbing?’

‘No,’ Blueberry explained, ‘I just slip off.’

‘Fortunately, you can rest in one of the morels on the ground.’ Toadstool said, relieving Blueberry. ‘Just go around the tree-trunk.’

Blueberry travelled along the circumference of the tree, attempting not to trip on the thick roots that carpeted the floor. The perimeter of the trunk measured longer than any tree Blueberry had ever seen from his old home; it challenged the width of a giant sequoia.

Soon, he came across a cluster of morels. In the vicinity of each, clay chimineas puffed smoke into the air, and each mushroom was furnished with an orange wooden door and windows that peeked into their large, hulking caps. Outside of each, a network of stepping-stone paths connected each shelter, lit with lanterns of glowing crystal. Blueberry was spoiled with choice.

‘Any one tickle your fancy?’ Toadstool asked.

‘Let me ask first,’ Blueberry inquired, ‘How did you get these mushrooms so big?’

‘They just grow like that around these parts, it’s gotta be the magic. My nation is known as Morelland for the fact that giant morels grow here.’

‘I’ll just take the closest one.’ Blueberry decided.

‘Fair choice.’ Toadstool bowed. ‘As long as you live under my roof, I am to serve you. A custom of the Deer Clan.’

‘I’m flattered!’ Blueberry exclaimed.

‘You can begin by fetching me some leaves to eat.’

‘Oh…’ Toadstool sighed. ‘Not that–it is also a custom that any guests must eat only with the family, from the same reserve of food, so no one gets poisoned. Dinner time is in an hour.’

‘I see. Just leave me be until the time arrives, then.’ Blueberry responded, grasping the front door of his shelter.

‘No doorknob?’ He asked.

‘Oh stonechild, here you go.’ Toadstool rubbed his hands together and opened the door, closing it once Blueberry had entered, with the same flaring magic that he had seen in the gateway and during their flight.

‘Thank you.’

‘It wasn’t a problem. I’m yours to command.’ Toadstool said.

Blueberry made himself comfortable once the door closed behind him. Sitting down on one of the seats, he looked around, noting that the inside of the shelter was a realm in and of itself.

The walls were decorated with tapestries and the shelves with ornaments and lanterns containing glowing crystals to light the room. The lower room had seats carved into the fungal walls, adorned with blankets and pillows, and the upper room was decorated in the same way, only with the addition of cotton beds. It was accessible with a ladder which had clearly not been used in years.

'Cozy.' he muttered to himself, watching the lights flicker orange and purple.

He looked for something to preoccupy himself with, and happened across a scroll made of tanned leaves kept closed with a ribbon. The scroll was illuminated with etched drawings beside the text, but Blueberry could not understand the writing.

The illumination seemed to tell stories of ancient civilisations, deities, and how worship used to be performed thousands of years ago. Blueberry's head tilted as he reached the end of the scroll, however. The images began to tell the story of how a civilisation made a temple to trap a swaddled baby made of rock, and how their empire fell once it couldn't protect them from evil.

He felt confused inspecting the scroll. The tanned leaf shimmered oddly in the light of the lanterns, and the image of the baby's smile glinted almost comically.

'Where is the moral to this story?' He thought to himself, amused. 'Don't trap babies in temples?'

Unable to take the scroll seriously any longer, he rolled up the leaves, tied the ribbon to close them, and placed them back where he found them. His attention moved to the door, which slowly opened.

There stood Toadstool, grunting. He was exerting himself as he put his effort into the slow-moving door. He made his way into the shelter, relieved to have opened it. It fell back into place with a soft thud. His eyebrows wobbled without stability.

'Is everything okay?' Blueberry asked.

'Yep.'

'Really? You look upset.'

Toadstool paused, looking at the ground, then at the door, and back again.

'Shit.' Toadstool uttered as the door knocked. He held his hand up at the door, bursting magic out of his fingers. A grunt rang out on the other side of the door, and the knocking stopped.

'"Family and business never meet." She said.' Toadstool interjected. 'Fucking liar.'

'WHO?'

The door blasted open, shards of wood gliding through the air like shrapnel.

'Weaselhunter.' Said the woman in the doorway.

'Really shit timing, Weaze.'

'Really shit goods, Toad.'

'You know what I have to go through. You can't blame me for not finding the highest quality items.'

'What? Last time it was a fool's gold nugget.' She mused. 'What's next? A 0th realm pen lid? And I see - you've picked up a nice, slimy, slugfolk for me.'

Weaselhunter came close to Blueberry; she towered over him.

'What's he for?' She asked.

'I…' Toadstool stuttered.

'You… got him for me? I'm flattered.' She taunted.

'No!' Toadstool exclaimed. 'I saved him… he was lost.'

'Has our favourite mushroom gone even more mushy?' She laughed. 'You've been like this ever since-'

She was cut off by a loud slap across the snout. Toadstool ran out of the shelter in the blink of an eye.

Blueberry got up, looking Weaselhunter down, and left, looking for Toadstool.

Weaselhunter appeared dumbstruck. Her greying, wiry, brown hair fell to her shoulders, and the rest of her hair was tied up into circular flower-like buns. Her bronze face was punctuated with wrinkles and her toned arms were illustrated with tattoos like the images that Blueberry had seen in the scroll.

Blueberry wandered through the streets of the city, looking for his companion. He could only catch fleeting glimpses of him. Blueberry returned to the place they had entered the realm, and caught his companion before he could leave.

'Where are you going?' Blueberry gasped.

'Back to where I was before.' Toadstool explained. 'Coming back home was a mistake.'

'But you need to spend time with your family.' Blueberry urged.

'And do what? Be abused by onlookers, found by people I "work for", reminded of why exactly I can't return?'

Blueberry stayed silent.

'It's not the first dinner I've had without my family. I'll be fine.'

'At least do it for me.' Blueberry responded.

'Huh? What obligation do I have to you?'

'I'm new to this world. I need to experience it. I'd be lost if you weren't here to give me my place.' Blueberry paused. 'And anyway. While I'm not under your roof at the moment, I'm still your guest; you know your customs.'

Toadstool looked at the ground, his tail stiff as it pointed toward the floor.

'Dinner is in 30 minutes. I'm going to go for a walk. Don't be late; return to the shelter.'

Blueberry nodded, returning. 'I hope they can use their magic to reform the door.' He thought to himself.

## Chapter 3

Toadstool walked into the gateway. Holding his breath, the sparks of magic flared about him as he was transported. In a moment he was taken to the southern hemisphere of the 0th realm; he was in the west. The moonlight gently beamed upon his skin.

He took a moment to compose himself, shaking sparkling powder out of his hair and off his fingertips. He walked through the tropical grasslands, finding solace in the dark backdrop provided by the wet, green trees and navy sky.

He continued walking, placing his hand in the air, casting a spell. Recoiling his hand back to his side, he now knew where to go. The charm had oriented him.

Smiling melancholically, he fled through the tall grass. He left behind a trail of disturbed greenery which appeared as if it were waving him goodbye. He methodically made his way to the entrance of a cave.

The ground seemed to have opened. Its gaping mouth pointed to the sky, welcoming Toadstool into its wet, dark mouth. He slowly glided over its forested lips and into the cavern, and reached the floor in the midst of the darkness that ate up his surroundings like ink.

Making use of magic once more, he drew a symbol into the palm of his hand with his finger. The symbol ignited with white light. Illuminating the cave, he walked through its natural hallways and nooks, and found an open room in the earth-hole.

He knew where this was; in fact, it was where he wanted to go, the cavern’s floor was almost completely empty save for stalagmites, moss, lichen, a small plot and a fallen block of stone in the centre. Toadstool walked closer to the plot, and fixed the stone to the plot’s head.

It was a grave.

‘I’m sorry…’ Toadstool let go, kneeling graveside.

The grave said nothing.

‘I know I’ve said it so many times over.’ He conceded.

The grave said nothing.

‘But I’m trying to be better.’

The grave said nothing.

‘I’m helping one of the Slugfolk to find a home.’ He admitted in the darkness. ‘I’m helping him live.’

The gravestone eased its posture. Toadstool perked up excitedly as he watched its response, but it only fell over.

‘Fuck.’

The damaged block sat pathetically against the cold, wet bedrock.

‘You’re not anything anymore.’ Toadstool snapped; the name on the stone had lost all distinction.

‘I’m crazy for thinking I’ll ever be able to spend time with you again.’ His eyes welled with tears.

‘But what do I expect of you? You’re just a grave.’ He continued, drawing the symbol of rest into the grave’s fluffy soil. The symbol sat on the ground. Toadstool felt as if it looked right to be there. Even if every grave would never open up again, he would still give rest to the lost–if Toadstool could, he’d make sure every grave had the same rest as this one did. Tears flowed onto the ground, watering the soil.

‘I promise…’

The room echoed with his words, silent apart from them and the dripping of water.

‘I promise to the Petrified Child I’ll leave this life behi-’ Toadstool’s words were cut off by the shout of a woman.

‘You’ll leave what!?’ Weaselhunter cut through the silence.

Toadstool jumped.

‘Like that’s true. You still owe me your continued career.’

'How did you find me?' He exclaimed.

Weaselhunter smirked, pausing. 'Our patrols.'

‘What did I even do to deserve this?’ Toadstool screamed, red in the face, rivers flowing from his eyes.

‘You signed up, murderer.’

Toadstool yelped, sobbing over the grave. ‘I can’t escape you!’

‘You can’t escape yourself. Your actions. Any other of us would have never let them hurt one of our family. But you–you let it happen. You killed her.’

Toadstool continued crying. ‘I know, I know, I know, I’m a murderer!’ He wiped the tears from his face with his scarf.

‘That’s right.’ Weaselhunter encouraged. ‘Stonechild cut you down for it.’ She paused, watching his reaction sadistically, picking back up the conversation with a proposition. ‘But… I need gold from a murderer.’

‘You need it from me?’

‘10 ancient human coins, truly golden. You have a week.’

Toadstool didn’t have it in him to say no; his throat locked up before he could get a squeak out. ‘Why not bronze?’ He thought to himself in his silent misery. ‘Why not steel?’

Weaselhunter walked out of the cavern as Toadstool stood, broken, begging and pleading on the inside. Pausing, she said one last thing.

‘Say "hi" to your mother for me.’ She shot out of the entrance of the cave in a blink.

As if he were finally able to pry his mouth open, Toadstool muttered something to himself.

‘Fucker.’

## Chapter 4

Toadstool arrived at his home.

For the first time in what felt as if it were ages, the tree stood familiarly tall over him, but the midday fog drew out its worst features. The winding, bending branches that snaked their way out from the trunk waved unsettlingly in the wind with plumes of golden leaves like flames angrily spitting and sputtering. He tried his hardest to look away from it, but the dangerous, burning fire he imagined in the canopy drew him close as if it were warm.

He couldn't help but go home again.

'Blueberry!' He called out. 'It's dinner time.'

The Slugfolk sheepishly came out from his shelter through the newly doorless entrance.

'What's her name… Wease?' Blueberry squeaked.  
'Weaselhunter?'

'She's your friend?' He asked.

Toadstool looked down at the floor, his tail limp and deflated. Blueberry had no answer.

'Dinner is up in the canopy. I'll take you up.'

'Sounds like a plan.'

Toadstool took Blueberry by the hand, taking him up with two fluttering wings of purple mist. They droned repeatedly but the duo paid them no mind.

Toadstool hoped that the dinner would go well. Having paid a visit to his family earlier, he knew that they'd have prepared a meal for the two. At the canopy, his family were all sitting on a pathway atop a branch.

'What's for dinner?' Toadstool said with childlike glee.

'The children have sweetberries, me and your father have nuts, and you… and your friend… have a tadpole.'

Toadstool scoffed. 'A tadpole? For the two of us?'

Blueberry looked at the food, at Toadstool, and at the family. 'I'll have the tail.'

'Does he think this is normal?' Toadstool thought to himself, furrowing his brow. 'Do slugfolk eat tadpoles?'

'Is something wrong?' Said one of Toadstool's young siblings, known as Toad Frog, noticing his expression.

'Stoolie's a picky eater.' Said another of his siblings.

Toadstool poked the dead creature which flopped limply on the clay surface of the path. 'Raw?' He asked.

'Of course.' His mother said bluntly.

Blueberry had already begun trying to eat it, his tongue scraping against its tail, but Toadstool wanted to vomit.

'Toadstool's turning green.' Said another child.

'I can't stomach this!' He yelled, kicking the tadpole onto the ground. It hit the ground distantly with a wet thud.

Blueberry jumped. 'You don't want it?'

'I don't know if it's different where you came from, but we don't even eat tadpoles here!' Toadstool growled.

'We eat frogspawn.'

'Good for you.' Toadstool grunted.

'If you don't want to eat what your father and I caught for you, then why are you even here?' Petal jeered.

'Because you're my family!'

'And family means so much to you?'

Toadstool's eyes began to well with tears. He tried to admit that yes, he really does care about his family, if only his throat could let anything out in-between his cries.

'Aren't ready to admit you only care about yourself?' She continued.

'He cares about me, right?' Blueberry butted in.

'Shut your mouth, slug.' She said; Blueberry gasped. 'He only helped you out to prove how good a person he is. But the truth is-'

Toadstool's claws dug into the pathway. As Petal spoke, he let out a cry. 'I didn't kill her! I didn't even want her to join the Bandits!'

'But you seemed ever so gleeful to know you weren't alone in your profession when she did.' Petal pointed out.

'Who did you kill?' Blueberry muttered.

'Nobody.' Toadstool squeaked. He knew what Petal would say if he were to pause; he took a deep breath in and continued. 'My cousin. Toad Blossom.'

'My niece.' Petal said.

'Cousin Blossie?' another of Toadstool's siblings said.

Toadstool wheezed involuntarily. 'Blossie… She joined the bandits. I'm sure she just wanted to be closer to me, right? But I'm not a good person. I don't work to do good things. I work for myself, alone. But I felt so happy to finally have a friend, a cousin, to work alongside; I wasn't alone, until she died.'

Petal herself began to cry. She and her husband's small hands cupped a couple of the childrens' ears. Toadstool let out a tear, and nudged Blueberry to help hide the children from the truth.

'I wasn't even there when they took her from us.’ He emphasised. ‘It was another bandit gang that got to her; she wouldn't give them what they hadn't paid for. She didn’t deserve it, she wasn’t meant for this line of work, and she paid with her life.’

The pathway fell silent and empty apart from the quiet cries amongst the family and Toadstool's shaky panting. It took a moment for the dialogue to continue once more.

'...If it weren't for you and your Stonechild forsaken job,' Petal said in-between her tears, 'She'd be here eating with us.'

Toadstool choked up. Nothing escaped his lips. Looking around, he realised that Blueberry wasn’t there with them. Frog looked up at Toadstool. ‘The slug jumped down.’

‘Stonechild damn the whole thing.’ Toadstool uttered.

Toadstool didn’t even glance at his family when he hopped down from the branch in search of Blueberry. ‘I can help you! Blueberry, damn it!’ He called out, his words echoing through the forest.

Toadstool knew that Blueberry couldn’t have gone far. Not only was he fragile and soft, but he was also too slimy to climb down. Toadstool frantically searched the lower branches, but it was in vain.

‘I can’t lose another friend!’ He called out.

The forest began to spin around him as his chest tightened. In the streaks of colour, swiftly blurring around him, he could see a figure on one of the branches. It was dark, shimmery, and had Blueberry’s clothes. It was him.

Before Toadstool could think, he ran toward his companion; his feet moved faster than his reason.

‘I can’t lose you.’ He panted.

‘You can’t lose me? You don’t know me. If anything, I’m doing you a favour by leaving. This way you can’t kill me.’

‘I wouldn’t kill you!’

Blueberry laughed; the wonder in his eyes had faded. ‘That’s what you said about Blossom.’

Toadstool was speechless as Blueberry walked further down the branch. In a blink, he had already consulted a labourer to send him down to the ground on a platform attached to a rope. He was gone.

From leagues away, Toadstool watched as his friend grew smaller and smaller in the wooded cityscape as he walked. He probably didn’t even know where he was going; at least until a streetside hag caught his attention.

The two, like ants, crawled into an alleyway. Having disappeared behind the tree-stumps and organic buildings of the city, the alley flared with the colours of magic. Toadstool threw his hat against the clay beneath his feet. ‘Fuck!’

He took the opportunity to float down to the ground. Running to the alleyway, an old woman stood alone; one large eye of hers was grey, and her crooked form was draped in rags. Four words scraped out of her mouth like a broken violin.

‘Mossrot sends his regards.’

Toadstool’s brow furrowed. ‘Send me to my friend!’ he growled.

‘Oh, to another place you will be reviled?’

‘To my friend.’ He angrily enunciated.

‘To a place you must be changed to enter. Hand over your magic.’

Toadstool eased in confusion ‘My… Magic?’

‘You lack the scars of purity.’ She responded, her clawed, thin fingers tracing two bowed scars below her curved ears.

Toadstool grunted, standing straight. ‘I see. I’m not giving in, you freak.’

The woman cackled and spun in amusement. ‘Freak!’

‘Yes!’

She laughed even harder. ‘Freak! Freak!’

Toadstool’s mouth stayed closed, his heart felt as if it were sinking.

‘Freak! Freak! Freak!’

Before she could repeat it once more, Toadstool had begun to run away.

He couldn’t stand to remain in the city. This place that once felt like home, years ago, was still hostile and uninviting. Too many people could understand the city, live well within it, but Toadstool never could wrap his mind around how it all worked. It was a mistake to return, a mistake to try to show he wasn’t the murderer, the freak, that people saw him as. He knew that he wasn’t made for that life.

Fleeing was always a safe option. Toadstool sighed, relieved to be away from the horror of civilization. His eyes happily adjusted to the sight of less and less people as his legs fluttered away, but as the world reduced to the wilderness, he felt empty. He patted down his pockets, thinking he may have dropped something, but everything was in check. He felt lonely.

It was the first time he had felt lonely in a long, long time. The last time he had felt like this was when Blossom had died, and since those feelings had faded he’d settled in disdain for his bandit ‘friends,’ his family, and every other person that held him guilty. With Blueberry gone, it felt as if this world was still stubbornly chipping away at his already empty heart. His head bowed in contempt and pity for himself.

‘Koala.’ He muttered, alone. ‘She can help me.’

If there were anybody who could cheer the bandit up, it was Koala; but Toadstool hadn't seen her in years. He didn't know if she knew, if her home was safe, but he needed hope and faith in destiny—despite how much it had used and abused him for no discernible reason—that there was at least one place he could call home. He hoped that Koala could be that for him.

## Chapter 5

‘Get up.’

‘In an hour… or a year.’

‘For the trees’ sake, Riverbell, get up. You're expected at the town centre by midday.’

‘Midday? Goodness! Blueberry, You should have woken me up sooner.’

‘I did.’

Riverbell sighed, looking up at the ray of sunlight dazzling through the half-eaten leaves above her.

‘What am I needed for?’

‘To arbitrate the latest petition.’

‘Are my people not able to decide for themselves?’

‘That's exactly what they're doing, it was only your father that made it so the sovereign had to give assent.’

‘Don’t mention my father.’
