## Overview
Ancient Sarvara was a civilisation of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) which was founded by the [early Morellic tribes](lore/2nd-realm/early-morellic-tribes.md) and spanned from the late neolithic era to the end of the Bronze age. The civilisation was centred in the city of Sarvara, which began as a city state built on the river Sarav and flourished into an empire which proved to have great influence on the region contemporarily and for millenia to come.
## The Neolithic Period
Sarvara wasn't concieved until the latter part of the neolithic period, or stone age. In the early to mid neolithic period, the region surrounding the river Sarav was travelled through, settled, abandoned, and forgotten innumerable times by various [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) groups.
### The Diiran Minikin
It wasn't until the [Diiran](lore/diira) minikin migrated from the west and settled the area that it gained permanent residence. The Diiran hunter-gatherers got to work building simple houses, creating pottery, and hunting in the region.[^1]

While the Diira had not innovated into agriculture, they survived off of the natural flora and fauna of the land, including berries, small mammals, fruit, nuts, insects, leaves, and bark. But their main food source was fish; the yield was so plentiful that the group was able to sustain itself purely off of the Sarav.
### The Mora Minikin
The Mora minikin hadn't yet migrated south into the Sarvaran river basin, but they would serve the most influence genetically and culturally on Sarvaran society. In the neolithic period, the Mora were nomadic pastoralists living in the steppes to the north of the Sanya mountains, who herded animals such as [snoutgoats](fauna/snoutgoats.md) and [woolly hogs](fauna/woolly-hogs.md).

Eventually, the early Morellic tribes were driven out of the steppes due to famine. The steppe was undergoing desertification and soil fertility was poor; and on top of the threat of starvation, the desert-dwelling peoples of the north were pillaging, thieving, and travelling in war parties to survive.

The Mora and other Morellic tribes migrated mainly south to the mediterranean-climate Sarvaran River Basin, spreading their territory throughout the lands they came through, although some groups travelled southwest. The Sanya mountains served as a great source of resources, especially copper and flint, which were used in the creation of tools and weapons such as darts.
## The Bronze Age
The bronze age came as the Mora settled down by the river Sarav and had begun to master the process of Agriculture. Not only was the soil in the basin rich and ferile, but the river also experienced predictable floods, meaning that farmers could plant their crops in anticipation. But ultimately, the migration wasn't clean, and there were many battles between the Mora and the Diira until the two found the confidence to coexist.
### The 1st Sarvaran Dynasty
The 1st Sarvaran Dynasty was founded by High Matriarch Coriandra I. It was Coriandra's guidance that aided the Mora in battle, and allowed them to squash the spirit of dissent amongst the Diirans during the Coriandran wars. Her tactical decisions governed the placement of new settlements, outposts, forts, and battlefields.

It wasn't until her daughter, Coriandra II, came into power that the wars subsided and diplomacy gained greater importance. Intermarriage was encouraged, not only for political reasons among the nobles, but also for genetic homogeneity among the commoners.

It was the Diirans that taught the Mora how to hunt and fish the local fauna effectively, and it was the Mora to teach the Diirans the art of animal husbandry with the livestock they brought. But the local flora was very easy to farm, and it didn't take long for both groups to begin planting [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) wheat, [Pelen](flora/pelen.md) root, and orchards worth of [Sarkitwara](flora/sarkitwara.md) trees and [Nyutabushes](flora/nyutabushes.md) together.
#### Aqhor
Another nation to emerge was [Aqhor](lore/aqhor.md), which was made up of seafarers from the southwestern continent. The city of Aqhor was built upon the delta of the river Sarav, and the nation controlled the lands surrounding the mouth of the river and the coastline.

Aqhor proved to be a beneficial trade partner to Sarvara, and the two entered a trade partnership that would last through to the end of the 1st dynasty. Aqhor mainly exported sweetrice, a rice plant brought over from the southwest that could only grow in the wetlands of the delta.
#### Coroth
Coroth was another nation, a Morellic nation that had migrated southeast to the continental forests. Coroth was less of a salient trade partner at this time, but their exports of blue dye and various textiles gained them great wealth during the Sarvaran Golden Age.
### The Founding of Sarvara and the Early Period
It was during the 1st dynasty that Sarvara was well and truly founded, marking the beginning of the Early Sarvaran Era. On a hill in a wooded area by the river Sarav, the city was founded on a small fishing settlement, chosen not only for its strategic geography but also for the surrounding lowlands, which were turned into farms, and the optimal location for fishing.

During Coriandra I's lifetime, the Temple of the High Matriarch was constructed on the peak of matriarch's hill, in what would become the royal district. It was here that the High Matriarch and the other members of her dynasty were to live, and the matriarch's nobles in the surrounding areas.
### The Middle Sarvaran Era
Eventually, all cultural and genetic distinctions between Diira and Mora were eroded into the singular ethnicity of 'Sarvaran,' and the territory of Sarvara expanded beyond the borders of the city state. And as agriculture was mastered by the Middle Sarvaran Era, various other innovations needed to be made.

With the growing complexity of trade, accounting became more important, and thus writing emerged in the form of the Elder Sarvaran Logography, a script which was etched into leaves with a sharp stylus and inked with dark natural pigments or dirt.

And as the Sarvarans were left with less labour to complete, time was left for the civilisation to develop its rich culture of religion and artwork. It was in this period that the mythic oral traditions of Sarvara were embellished to the point of fiction, and Coriandra I was mythologised into a legendary figure.

Furthermore, pottery began to be seen not only as a means for storage and cleanliness but also as an art form in and of itself. Clay from the banks of the Sarav was sought by many groups and sold for a lot of money for its high quality, and became a staple of Sarvaran pottery from then until eternity.

The military of Sarvara was greatly developed in this era as well. The greatest minds of Sarvara were recruited to devise new methods of warfare, new weapons, and new spells for the military, which went on to win so many battles that Sarvara began to be a feared adversary to its enemies.
### The Sarvaran Golden Age
By the Sarvaran Golden Age, also known as the Classical Sarvaran Era, the language of Sarvara was standardised into Classical Sarvaran, and the Middle Sarvaran Logography had developed into the Classical Sarvaran Script, an abjad etched into leaves and also carved into wood. The oral tradition was now codified into scripture, and read out reverently in the temples.

The golden age was a period of great cultural, technological, and religious development. It was in this time that the Sarvaran civilisation reached its peak, and it wouldn't be until the Empire of the Petrified Child that society would reach and surpass such development.

The Sarvaran Golden Age saw the emergence of poetry as an art form, and many many poets lived, left their mark, and died; their poems would be read about fires, their songs sung in the temples, and their spells recited and cast for centuries to come. Sarvaran poetry was distinct for its unique metrical structure, influenced by the polysynthetic grammar of the language.

Furthermore, the golden age was marked by a distinct lack of conflict. The civilisation was greatly pacifistic in worship of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), and surrounding nations didn't see the use in warring with such a great trade partner and military power.
### The Late Sarvaran Era
The Late Sarvaran Era began with the end of the Sarvaran Golden Age and the emergence of the Great Plague. The plague decimated Sarvaran civilisation, spelling the end of the 1st dynasty. It was High Matriarch Fennel III, a noble, who took leadership over Sarvara as the first high matriarch of the 2nd dynasty after the 1st dynastic family line had all but perished.

It was in this period that the Fennellic wars began. These were a series of battles began not only between Sarvaran nobles vying for power, but also between the nations of the river basin. For example, Aqhor, rather than seeing Sarvara as a trade partner, joined in the battle against the 2nd dynasty in search of wealth, resources, slaves, and power.

Sarvara was greatly weakened, and the urban environments were all but abandoned - the city of Sarvara was lost. Furthermore, Classical Sarvaran was no longer spoken; rather, a rural dialect gained prestige after Fennel fled to the countryside and her dynasty based itself in her family villa.
### The Lost Era
The Lost Era was defined by the fall of the city of Sarvara. It was in this time that the 2nd dynasty struggled to stay afloat, but protected its disparate rural territories with fervent vigor, leading to such settlements gaining a foothold in the wake of the Great Plague.

In this period the nation of [Coroth](lore/coroth.md) gained greater importance, supporting the remnants of Sarvara out of a sense of sisterhood. The two formed a political, military, and trade relationship.

Eventually, the 2nd dynasty culminated in the last battle of the Fennellic wars between Sarvara and Aqhor. The battle ended with the death of the last high matriarch of the 2nd dynasty, High Matriarch Saffron II. From here, the great Corothic general known as Elephant I was elected High Patriarch (the first Patriarch in Sarvarn history) by the Sarvaran nobles, spelling the beginning of the the Empire of the Petrified Child and the 1st Stonechild Dynasty.
## The Iron Age
The iron age began as minikin began to collect iron in mines and use it in tools. It was Coroth that had begun learning how to smelt the metal down, and they brought this knowledge with them as they entered the Sarvaran River Basin and grew in power under the banner of the Empire of the Petrified Child
### The Founding of the Empire of the Petrified Child
The Empire of the Petrified Child was founded by High Patriarch Elephant I, and was headquartered in the northern settlement of Nayura.
