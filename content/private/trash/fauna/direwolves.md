## Overview
Direwolves are a group of carnivorous, predatory canines native to the infra-essent realms. They are descended from prehistoric dire wolves, now extinct in the 0th realm. They are larger than their ancestors, and inhabit the forests and plains of their respective realms.
## Appearance
Direwolves are large, reaching lengths of over 2 metres from the snout to the base of the tail at maturity. They have dark grey fur with light spots, mimicking dappled sunlight and shadows. Their eyes are thin and light, and they have large pawprints with sharp claws.
## Behaviour
Direwolves are diurnal hunters, travelling in packs. They opt to chase and overwhelm their prey in number, utilising [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) to create strange noises and false animal calls to confuse their prey. They are highly territorial, protective of their young, and mate for life. Their young are instilled with a deep sense of kinship, and their litters are large enough to ensure the structure of a pack. Their firstborn are generally the strongest, and are the second in the heirarchy to their parents.
## Diet
Direwolves are carnivorous, consuming medium-sized mammals such as rabbits, wildcats, and ruminants including deer. Given the opportunity, they will also consume animals from other locations and habitats such as [weasels](fauna/weasels.md) and [widrens](fauna/widrens.md).
