## Overview
The Petrified Child is a semi-corporeal deity which is worshipped in many monotheistic and polytheistic religions, and can reside within both the corporeal realms and the dreamscape. The child inherits its existence from the [Judges](cosmology-1/celestial-beings/the-judges.md), serving as their heir and the protector of all things natural and holy, destroying all things that would desecrate the cosmos[^1], which it sees as evil.
## Behaviour
The Petrified Child can manifest itself at anywhere within the corporeal realms, utilising [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) to enter and exit the dreamscape at any location. It hovers through space to locomote, and destroys the purpetrators of evil by transfiguring them into a material known as 'Baby Sludge.
### Baby Sludge
Baby Sludge is a highly fertile, soil-like substance created upon the destruction of evil by the Petrified Child. It was designed by the Judges to trigger the proliferation of the natural world, resulting in beautiful regions of ecosystemic prosperity known as Baby Meadows.

However, baby sludge itself is highly dangerous before it is incorporated into nature. It highly fortifies all aspects of nature to achieve its goal (including decay, rot, pathogens, and bacteria), resulting in swift death through infection or necrosis to those who come in contact with it.
## Appearance
Within the corporeal realms, the Petrified Child is bound within rock, as all beings with a [soul](cosmology-1/darkness.md) require a body to exist within the physical realms. Thusly, it has the appearance of a swaddled infant made from stone, and is very large, about 5 metres in length.

Its body has a smooth, bean-like, inverse-teardrop shape, and its face is round, with [minikin](fauna/minikin.md)-like features, and eyes which are forever closed. Its body is also defined by swirling creases (A result of the effects of [alucinara](cosmology-1/alucinara.md) on physical matter) which resemble folds of cloth.
