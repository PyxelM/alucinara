## Overview
Sharadism is a physiological condition that affects organic beings. It causes those affected, known as Sharadith[^1], to undergo many irreversable physical, mental, and spiritual changes, resulting in a grotesque appearance and insatiable need to consume the blood and flesh of others.
## Spiritual Effects
The effects of contraction of Sharadism on the soul are markedly drastic. Those affected lose possession of their souls, which return to the pond, and rather the Sharadic Angel sends down its own spirit into the bodies of the Sharadith.

As the Sharadith's souls are extensions of the Sharadic Angel, and thus holy in the eyes of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md), they have the capability of committing evil acts (such as murder, cannibalism, and exsanguination) without alerting the Child to destroy them.
## Contraction
Sharadism is contracted when an organic being is exposed to the bodily fluids of a carrier. Only few carriers are largely symptomless, integrating into society without a problem, and without their condition being discovered.

A common method of contraction is the consumption of tainted animal meat or plant flesh, such as from a hunted animal with Sharadism, or a foraged plant which has gained the condition from contact with another Sharadh.

Another method is through the deliberate turning of another being. This is customary in some Minikin cultures as criminal punishment, but can also be carried out when a Sharadh pack dwindles in number and the remaining members seek out new recruits. This is achieved through bites or scratches, which penetrate the skin, but do not kill the victim.
## Turning
When one contracts Sharadism, they don't fully transform into a Sharadh until the night after, usually in their sleep. In this sleep, they appear dead, but don't decompose beyond a pale and dry appearance. Once the transformation is complete, they appear as a Sharadh, and can infect others.
## Appearance
Sharadith differ in appearance from their healthy counterparts, in that they exhibit:
- Greater accumulaton of haemoglobin and red iron pigments in the body, leading to a ruddy appearance and red eyes.
- Complete hair loss or alopecia universalis.
- A larger body, with longer, sinewy limbs, and thicker nails, due to greater secretion of growth hormones.
- Stronger bones and teeth, due to remineralisation and greater calcium consumption.
- Sharper teeth and fingernails, due to a pathological compulsion to file or sharpen them.
## Behaviour and Pathology
The behaviour of Sharadith also differs from their healthy counterparts, as they exhibit:
- A lack of interest in socialising with others or associating with civilisation, prefering to stay in small, matriarchal groups of other Sharadith.
- Infertility, leading to new Sharadith being turned only through contraction
- Unpredictable and socially unacceptable behaviour, hallucinations, confusion, ceaseless anger, and insatiable hunger.
- Avoidance of cooked or plant-based foodstuffs, preferring wholly to consume raw meat, bones, and blood.
- Extreme heliophobia and pyrophobia, leading to nocturnal sleeping patterns.
