The Morellic Culture is ultimately one of the most widespread cultures of the southern half of the [Western Continent](geography/2nd-realm/western-continent.md).

## Migration
The earliest morellic groups inhabited the peninsula northwest of the sarvaran gulf. Here, the widespread language was Proto-Morellic. Due to the mountainous nature of the peninsula, many communities would be isolated from another - resulting in intense dialectal variation and divergence into separate languages.

Having descended from an equatorial nomadic tree-dwelling tribe titled 'the people who will be strong,' or '*Uinh Sayamitu Mozailyen*,' a lot of the groups inherit their name from the title - hence the term 'Morellic,' from [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) '*Oin Arayamith Moreillę*.'

One group lived above the river Saarn - this word, meaning 'Green' in proto-morellic, was named after the lush green foliage along the river's bank. This foliage, out of place for a mountainous environment, was actually caused by a baby meadow - one whose sludge flowed down river, enhancing the soil along it for the growth of algae, flora, and fauna.

However, eventually this group migrated from the peninsula. Due to soil depletion and increased natural disasters, a famine struck the land about 7,000 YA. This event was termed 'the terrible era,' or '*Uinh Osvelu Makvenil*.'

Sailing south-west over water and then eastward over land, they travelled to what they would eventually call 'Sarvara,' or '*Sarwarą*.' This was the beginning of the [Sarvaran Culture](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md).
