## Overview
Morellic Culture is the culture of the morellic [minikin](species/fauna/sapient/minikin.md). The name is a larger term for many related cultural-ethenic groups, all descended from a common ancestor 7,000 years ago, known as the Moreillu[^1] Tribe.

The original Moreillu tribe spoke [Proto-Morellic](languages/proto-morellic.md), and existed as a group of formerly nomadic minikin, who had settled in the mountains of the northeastern peninsula.

- The creator created alucinara which created the realms (or suns, tar, darkness) which created the worlds which created the land and sea which created the mountains (or earth, dirt) which created the trees (or plants) which created the animals which created the people.
- Alucinara, being the first thing the creator created, is a sacred energy which takes the form of alucinarium. It is the energy which initially gives life to newborns, defines the laws of nature and the universe, and allows animals to take the darkness for their own means.
- The mountains also created the petrified child who indescriminately and infallibly destroys evil for the sake of our safety, and never destroys what does not deserve it.
- The trees also created the mushroom goddess Omoza who created the mushrooms to give the people food, visions, and shelter from rain.
- The tail is the most sacred limb of an animal, as it is the place where the soul resides.
- When removed, the tail still houses the soul, which can only be released to the land of the dead by burning the tail. Otherwise burying the tail will trap it until it is destroyed when claimed by the deities to rot.
- The fortuitary gland is the second most sacred part of one's body, as it allows one to take use of alucinara.
- When removed, the fortuitary gland will still retain alucinara energy and a semblance of life until it begins to rot as the deities claim it, or it is burnt, in which case the alucinarium will react to light up with alucinara energy as it is released back into nature. 
- Female minikin are greater than male minikin, as female minikin are sacred enough to give birth to, nurse, and guide their litter. Male minikin cannot give birth to their litter as they are lesser than female minikin. It is because of this that the eldest female minikin should be the one to rule over their family or community as matriarch. Similarly, male minikin should not be permitted to act as spiritual leaders, as they are not as sacred as female minikin.
- If someone is to steal, kill without reason, or take another's husband, cut their tail from them and bury it. This is because crime is reason enough to remove one's soul.
- Squirrels are the ancestors of Minikin and are sacred animals because of this. They exist on land to watch and observe others, this is how the petrified child knows when and where evil is performed. As the descendants of squirrels, Minikin are also sacred animals.
- Sacred animals should not be eaten for fear of the punishment of sickness and death, as they have been claimed by the deities in life.
- Rotten meat has been claimed in death by the deities to be eaten, and should not be eaten by minikin for fear of punishment.
- Mushrooms should only be eaten if they do not kill, as poisonous mushrooms are sacred and should not be eaten for fear of death.
- A vision triggered by a mushroom is a sacred one, and should not be blasphemed. If a vision is not easily interpreted, one should go to a spiritual leader, and ask her to interpret it. She will place her hand on one's chest, interfacing with the sacred Alucinara energy within the Fortuitary Gland.
- Snails are sacred animals, and have been claimed in life by the deities. This is why they have shells, to protect them from whosoever may kill them. Slugs are not sacred, as they have not been protected with a shell.
- Similarly, fruit and nuts with shells or peels (such as oranges or bananas) should not be eaten, this is because they have also been claimed. This is why they have shells or peels, to protect them.
- When eating an animal, its tail should not be eaten for fear of punishment, it should be rather cut off and burnt in fire. If the animal killed a minikin or a sacred animal before its death, its tail should be buried.
