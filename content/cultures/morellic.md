The Morellic Culture is ultimately one of the most widespread cultures of the southern half of the [Western Continent](geography/2nd-realm/western-continent.md).

## Migration
The earliest morellic groups inhabited the peninsula northwest of the Morellic gulf. Here, the widespread language was Proto-Morellic. Due to the mountainous nature of the peninsula, many communities would be isolated from another - resulting in intense dialectal variation and divergence into separate languages.

Having descended from an equatorial nomadic tree-dwelling tribe titled 'the people who will be strong,' or '*Uinh Sayamitu Mozailyen*,' a lot of the groups inherit their name from the title - hence the term 'Morellic,' from [Sarvaran](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md) '*Oin Arayamith Moreillę*.'

One group lived above the river Saarn - this word, meaning 'Green' in proto-morellic, was named after the lush green foliage along the river's bank. This foliage, out of place for a mountainous environment, was actually caused by a baby meadow - one whose sludge flowed down river, enhancing the soil along it for the growth of algae, flora, and fauna.

However, eventually this group migrated from the peninsula. Due to soil depletion and increased natural disasters, a famine struck the land about 7,000 YA. This event was termed 'the terrible era,' or '*Uinh Osvelu Makvenil*.'

The migration spanned a decade, or its equivalent. Led by a woman known as 'Mumo,' 'Waterweasel,' or '*Oellęlith Mumǫ*,' the group of about 500 people sailed in a fleet of 25 boats of 20 or so people sailed from the peninsula to an area south-west of the Morellic gulf.

The journey was perilous. While the lands were tameable, the seas were uncontrolled - only used for fishing; no Minikin dared to take on the waves but Mumo, and the people knew they had no other option than to follow her.

In fact, Mumo wasn't the most popular lady. She was known to make little sense, to talk to herself, and to be alone in her tree for the majority of the day. But she, unusual as she was, was willing to break from the mould - to finally take on the ocean where no other minikin was willing to.

The boats of the fleet were bought with Mumo's food. She, living by herself, was easily able to forage and farm berries, fruits, and nuts without using them up, which she eventually used to buy 100 servants. These servants formerly served the greatest fishermen in the peninsula, and were eventually able to build the boats with wood, reeds, leaves, and linen.

Many myths were formed over the journey - it was said that Mumo was able to split an enormous eel of the abyss down the middle just by screaming at it just before it devoured the entire fleet, that Mumo fed the fleet across its journey with fish that she took from the ocean by levitating them from the surface into the boats. It is likely that these powers of Mumo's were a result of fine-tuned [Alucinarium](phenomena/alucinara.md) use, as her powers were not out of the question given Minikin's ability to use magic.

Sailing south-west over water and then eastward over land, they travelled to what they would eventually call 'Sarvara,' or '*Sarwarą*.' This was the beginning of the [Sarvaran Culture](cultures/morellic/sarvaran.md), a people group native to the banks of the Sarvaran Lake, where the city-state of Sarvara stood.

Mumo, revered as a [Daughter of Stone](religions/morellic.md), was the first queen of the new land they reached. Her leadership was the beginning of the matriarchal system that Sarvara and its descendants retained.
