The Neth River Civilisation existed in 7,000 YA.

## Location
The NRC (Neth River Civilisation) was located along the [Neth River](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent/neth/neth-river.md), which flowed from the [Nessaui lake](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent/neth/nessaui-lake.md) into the [Sarvaran Gulf](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent/sarvara/sarvaran-gulf).

The biome around the river was the tropical rainforest of the [central continent](locations/2nd-realm/central-continent/central-continent.md)'s equator; This led to increased contact with Demi-Slug peoples, who lived further inland away from flowing water and near stiller ponds and humid areas.

## Language
The Neth River minikin spoke [proto-neth](languages/neth/proto-neth.md).

## Culture
### Food
Neth River minikin would mainly eat leaves, larvae, fruit, and veg. The NRC was a rare example of a vegitarian minkin culture - this was mainly influenced by the poisonous fauna of the area.

### Love
Neth River minikin would usually have 1-3 partners whom they would each have more than one children with.

This mirrors the [morellic](cultures/morellic/morellic-culture.md) minikin's large litters, as each system of mating would usually result in families of each culture having a similar amount of offspring in each new generation, with Neth River families spreading their litters across many partners.

### Religion
#### Creator Deity
It is believed that the world was created by a poisonous amphibian known as a [g’athre](fauna/2nd-realm/amphibia/g’athre.md) (Proto-Neth: `/ɠáθɾɛ/`) when the creature released the universe from its nostrils as a defence mechanism against an evil weasel.

##### The Proverb of the G’athre; "When a weasel arrived, the g’athre survived."
> d’äl urkine pag’a ed’ra, g’athre hensag’a ed’ra.
