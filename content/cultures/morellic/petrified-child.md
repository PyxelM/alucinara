## Appearance
The petrified child appears throughout the majority of history  as a floating bean-shape with a face inset into the top half.

### Owl
The petrified child began being depicted with an owl's face around the beginning of the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md). 

This was due to the fact that, not only were owls a significant predator against [minikin](fauna/2nd%20realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md) (further influencing the idea of the petrified child as a being whom brings death in the name of good), but also the word for "child" and "owl" evolved into the same form in the [Stonechild Imperial](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/stonechild-imperial/stonechild-imperial.md) language.

### Face Location
Around the time that the [Empire of the Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/stonechild-empire/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md) fell, the petrified child's face moved from the front of its body to the top.

Retaining the owl-like face, the deity grew a more realistic appearance, influenced by the clay-workers of the Morellic culture who found it difficult to attach a face to the front.
