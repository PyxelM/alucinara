## Writing
Writing initially began as symbols stitched into [fabric](material/fabric.md). At first, there was little distinction between sewing and writing, scenes would be sewn into tapestry in order to keep record of famous battles or significant stories.

This led to the eventual creation of the Morellic Logography, separately standardised in different communities by farmers and others who wished to keep record of transactions.

In addition, the Sarvaran Era was the first to see a compilation of cultural myths - the [Everything Tapestries](artefacts/everything-tapestries.md).
