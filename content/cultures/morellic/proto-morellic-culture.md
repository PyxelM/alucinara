The proto-morellic culture existed at around 7,000YA. The culture began as the two tribes, Rhohita and Cervina, met.

## Language
[Proto-morellic](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/proto-morellic.md) was the language spoken by the proto-morellic culture.

## Beliefs
### Origin
Proto-morellic minikin correctly believed that they came from squirrels. In fact, they were created by the fertility god Lwubo.

Lwubo, the child of the Great Tree, was envious of her creator for creating humanity. She saw them create great structures and take advantage of their realm, and wanted to make her own "humans."

Of course, it wouldn't be feasible to create duplicates of the race, so she took her favourite animal of the 0th Realm, Squirrels, and with the help of the fire god, melted an array of squirrels into clay.

She would mould them to her satisfaction, giving them anthropoid body plans, but unlike humanity she gave them snouts, digitigrade feet, tails, and [fortuitary glands](fauna/biology/fortuitary-gland).

Once done, she enlisted the help of the fire god's brother, the ice god, to freeze her creatures, after which she scattered them across the landscape of the [2nd Realm](locations/2nd-realm/2nd-realm.md).

### The Tail
As the proto-morellic minikin believed they had come form squirrels, they saw their tails as a direct physical manifestation of their connection to their divine ancestors.

#### Tail Removal
Due to their deification of the body part, lack of them was a major taboo, and removal of the tail was reserved for criminal punishments or extreme counter-cultural body modification.

The lack of a tail was seen that a Minikin's body was desecrated. It was common to throw stones or other objects at tail-less others, as bruising and wounding an already desecrated body would bring luck to those whom still retained their tails.

##### Weaponry
In fact, as the proto-morellic culture became more advanced, a specialised weapon was developed to cut off tails, similar to the guillotine in the 0th Realm.

The weapon was handheld, similar to a sickle, but was incredibly sharp - designed to take the extremity off in one swipe.

By the time of the Sarvaran civilisation, the weapon was mainly kept for religious and decorative purposes, displayed upon the trunk of one's Family Tree. This deterred intruders from stealing resources or other items out of fear.
