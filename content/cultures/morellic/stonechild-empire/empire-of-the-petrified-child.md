## Culture
Stonechild Imperial culture was heavily influenced by the mythology surrounding the [Petrified Child](cultures/morellic/deities/petrified-child.md) (Stonechild Imperial: **Äryýsh**, from Proto-Morellic ***Asteihar**) Thus, religion was a big factor in the workings of society.

### Monasticism
Stonechild Monks were known to live underground and blind themselves in a ritual known as **The Blinding** (Stonechild Imperial: **Swýp Evebozhát**, from Proto-Morellic ***Símeh Avapuhigháneh**.) This ritual led to permanent blindness, and symbolised the monks' connection to the Petrified Child in that they wouldn't allow themselves to see any anything if it lacked the same perfection as their deity.

## Language
The lingua franca of the Empire of the Petrified Child was [Stonechild Imperial](languages/morello-rudhiric/morellic/sarvaran/stonechild-imperial/stonechild-imperial.md).
