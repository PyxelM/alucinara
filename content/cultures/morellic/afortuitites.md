The Afortuities are a cultish group of Minikin who abstain from the use of Alucinara due to moral and religious reasons.

## Beliefs
The Afortuitites believe that Alucinara is a gift from the Morellic deities meant to tempt Minikin's resolve against evil.

If a person is evil, they will inevitably be tempted by Alucinara and use it for immoral means.
If a person is good, they will abstain from it - lifelong abstaince is the highest virtue in Afortuitite culture.
