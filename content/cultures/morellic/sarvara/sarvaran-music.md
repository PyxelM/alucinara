## Instruments
### The Rainslug
The Rainslug (Sarvaran: **Oveýsllea** `/ɔˈʋéý̯s.ɬea̯/`) was originally a children's toy made of many hollow hemispheres linked by ball-and-socket joints, taking an appearance reminiscent of a slug.

It found use as an instrument first outside of the mainstream, used as percussion, akin to a shaker, alongside Sarvaran poetry.

However, as time went on, it found more use and was introduced into more snooty and higher-class performances. It may have been paired with poetry as outside of the mainstream, but also evolved use alongside poetic yodelling which was influenced by the pitch accent of [Sarvaran](languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md).
