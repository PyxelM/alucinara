The Sarvaran Civilisation existed around 7,000YA, and spoke [Sarvaran](languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md).

# Notable People
## Hastini the Elephant
Hastini the Elephant `Sarvaran: Hestį́da /xesˈtĩ́.da/`was a Sarvaran general who was known to wear a copper elephant mask over his mouth. This amplified his voice, and led to the depiction that he was taller than his compatriots and even had the head of an elephant himself, although these were exagerrations or erroneous.

## Dhanakai the Sabre-toothed
Dhanakai the Sabre-toothed `Sarvaran: Zędákea /zẽˈdá.kea̯/` was a Sarvaran king regarded as a despot. He was known to glue the mouths of dissidents shut with the naturally ocurring adhesive of the [Silkvine Plant](flora/silkvine/silkvine.md) and leave them to starve.

## Amkani the Cartographer
Amkani the Cartographer `Sarvaran: Ęmką́da /ẽmˈkã́.da/` was a Sarvaran cartographer regarded as the father of the [Sarvaran Writing](languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran-logography.md). He would use the [Old Sarvaran](languages/morellic/sarvaran/old-sarvaran.md) logographs in the margins of his maps, but eventually decided to standardise his logographs as to be more organised, but this spread throughout the whole Sarvaran civilisation, military first. The use of Amkani's maps influenced the writing of the many generals, and eventually the common people of the civilisation.
