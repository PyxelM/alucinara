## SCRIPTURA EX MUNDO PRAE ET POST FRACTO
### Chapter 1
### The Cosmos Given Shape
Before Lunuth had first sprouted, before it had been ground into flour or baked into bread, the first Judge and the second Judge ruled the cosmos, to give it order. And the second Judge was subordinate to the First, and was not able to decree the laws of nature, for it was a counsellor to the First.

But the cosmos was destitute, and shapeless. And so the second Judge said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given shape.' Hearing this, the First decreed that the cosmos must be given shape, and from the void emerged dust and water, all of the material of the cosmos.

But the Judges could not see their creation, and thus the second Judge said, 'we must create a light, so that we may see our creation.' Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that a light may be created, and from the void emerged flames bright enough that they should see their entire creation. And the Judges named this light, 'Sun.'

But all things were at rest, and without order. And so the second Judge  said to the First, 'the cosmos must be given order.' But the First said, 'this is not a task for us, but for another rank.' And so the First created the Angels to govern the materials of the cosmos, according to the laws of nature. And the Judges contained the laws within an immanent energy throughout all of the cosmos, and named this energy, 'Alucinara,' for they had invisioned it.

And the Angels had license to decree all things within their dominion, and the Angels looked upon the cosmos, decreeing, 'it is good that the dust and water should collect in lands and seas, and that the lands should collect by the sun, and that the seas should collect on lands.' And so the lands collected in planets, and moons, and belts, around the light. They also decreed all other things in the cosmos that they saw fit.
### The Second Judge's Covetousness and the Spirits of Darkness Created
Now the second Judge was covetous of the first Judge's authority, saying, 'why should my superior and my subordinates decree all things, and I not, but rather to counsel them? Is not the beauty that has been created my own, for I advised its creation?' And so the second Judge hid from the First in secret, and decreed new laws of nature. And the Second contained these laws within an energy incarnate in spirits, and named this energy, 'Darkness,' for it was hidden from the First and the Angels.

And the spirits of Darkness asked the second Judge, 'O glorious, may you please fill us, that we may not be dishonourably hungry, and that our hunger may not dishonour you?' And so the second Judge gave the spirits dust to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, do you mean to dishonour us further? Fill us with something that should match your glory, that we may be a testament to it.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a moon to eat, but the spirits were not filled, saying, 'O glorious, you dishonour yourself if you are to suppose that this matches your glory! Fill us with something greater.' And so the second Judge gave the spirits a planet to eat, but the spirits were not filled.

Now the spirits of Darkness did not fear judgement, as they were hidden. Distrusting their creator, they saw it well to consume other things, and thus began to eat other moons, other planets, and to drink seas, till there was nothing left but the Sun, and the Judges, and the Angels. Now the first Judge was horrified by the devestation that had been unleashed by the spirits, saying to its companion, 'why have you created these spirits? Do you not know it dishonours you to destroy the cosmos we gave shape to? I will surely have to destroy these spirits, lest they destroy the cosmos at last.' But the spirits, hearing that they should be destroyed, set themselves against the first Judge, to consume it.
### the First Judge Destroyed and the Cosmos Shattered
But the first Judge and the Angels battled the spirits of Darkness, decreeing that each spirit should be returned to the cosmos as energy and matter. Now the advantage of the spirits were too great, and the Judge could not see it well. And it came to pass that the spirits defeated the Judge, and consumed it. But the power of the first Judge was too great, even in death, and the cosmos and everything within it was shattered, and scattered across many realms.

And so the surviving spirits of Darkness asked, 'O glorious, are we not now a testament to your glory?' But the Judge was ashamed of the consequences of its actions, and its heart was set against the spirits, saying, 'surely, you will not defeat me as you have consumed my companion.' And the spirits said, 'yes, for you are glorious.' But the Judge wept, saying, 'my companion was right, you were never to be the one testament to my glory, but rather this cosmos of our design. I see now that you lack glory, and your existence will forever shine unfavourably upon me.' And the spirits were afraid, saying, 'do you intend to destroy us?' And the Judge said, 'nay, for I cannot destroy, but I will create a punishment worthy of your iniquity.'
## Chapter 2
### New Laws of Nature Decreed and Spirits Given Form
And thus the Judge decreed new laws of nature, that the remnants of the cosmos may be protected from further destruction. And the Judge contained the new laws within an energy to replace the energy of Alucinara, and the Judge named this new energy, 'justification,' for the spirits of Darkness were punished for their iniquity.

And so the Judge took the energy of Alucinara, and contained it within crystals, saying, 'the beauty of the old laws of the Angels shall appear from within beautiful crystals.' Also the Judge took the energy of Darkness, and contained the spirits within bodies of pitch, saying, 'it is befitting that you should be like filth, collecting in the dark places of the earth, for you are deserving of punishment.'

But the spirits of darkness were unhappy with their bodies, saying, 'we must escape the dark places of the earth.' And so they called out to the Angels, saying, 'are you not unhappy having authority over the dirt? Come, let us create new bodies for us, that you may have authority over something greater.' And so the Angels formed bodies of clay for the spirits, and the spirits of pitch resided within them, and escaped the dark places of the earth.
### The Spirits Fired into Flesh, Stars, and Kinds
Now the Judge was upset when it heard of this, saying, 'you have once again commited an act of iniquity against my decree.' But the spirits gloated, and said, 'are you not ashamed? for we have escaped the dark places of the earth, and created new bodies for ourselves greater than any thing you could create.' And the Judge was deeply wroth, saying, 'a false belief has sprouted within you, that you are greater than I, but I say that you inherit your greatness from me. I see that your new bodies are great, for they were created by the Angels, but the Angels are from me.' 

But the spirits of Darkness would not listen, and so the Judge said, 'I decree that your bodies be fired into flesh, that you may toil to consume one another to survive, only to age and perish in the order of your years. And in death, you will burn within the heavens, as stars.' And so the Judge send a flame from the Suns upon the spirits, that they may be fired into flesh, as living beings. And the Judge said, 'I grant you one good thing, that you may bear heirs, and build families, that your legacy is not forgotten, and that the balance of life and death is even, and good.' And so the Judge sent a few spirits down upon the lands and seas, and the rest it kept within the heavens, to burn as stars, and they burn as stars to this day.

And it came to pass that the living beings made homes for themselves, and were separated in kinds from one another by the Angels, into plants and animals. And so the plants fed upon the light of suns and were humble, and the animals fed upon all other living beings and were not humble, and so the plants were given many years to live, and the animals were given less. And the Angels also appointed another kind, mould, to fulfil the laws of decay and perishing. And another kind, people, was set apart from the animals, to be a kind abounding with wisdom and worship of the Judge.
### The Judge Becomes the Petrified Child in its Sorrow
Now the Judge's heart was deeply afflicted, and it sorrowed for the first, and for the cosmos that was shattered. And the Judge repented, and cried out, saying, 'how it should have been me to die! For I am of lesser character than you, O my companion, whom I destroyed in my iniquity.' But the people were confused, saying, 'surely our creator has gone insane, for its heart is deeply afflicted.' And the people went unto the Judge, asking, 'are you well?' But the Judge said, 'nay, for I am deeply troubled, and my heart is burdened by remorse, and there is no Angel nor other thing to set things right.' And the people said, 'there is virtue in redemption, our creator, and it is your duty to set things right.'

And the Judge's heart was deeply moved, and the Judge said, 'it behoves me to redeem myself.' And so the Judge lifted its voice, saying, 'I decree that I should be bound by the one duty now to protect the people whom I created an eld ago, and whom I justly punished, and rightly humiliated.' And so the Judge took itself and gave itself a body. And the Judge was petrified of the sins of its past, and was made of stone, and gave itself the image of a child, that it may be made humble among people. And the people looked upon the Judge and gave it a new name, that is, 'the Petrified Child.'
### The People Create the Watchstones and Forget the Petrified Child
Now the Petrified Child's vision was greatly limited, and was not able to protect the people well. And so it came to pass that the people built eyes for the Petrified Child, that it may see, to protect them. And these people carved these eyes into stone, and named them 'watchstones,' for the petrified child also was made of stone. And thus the people built watchstones in cliff-faces, boulders, rocks, and pebbles, and kept them as charms within their pockets, that they may be protected from the evil of one another, and the beasts.

But it came to pass that some people were evil, and hid from the petrified child, and did not build watchstones within their inner rooms, and homes, that they may hurt one another without fear of retribution. And they did not teach their daughters and sons of the petrified child, for they were evil. And so the people died, and their daughters did not inherit faithful knowledge, and the watchstones were worn away over the generations.
