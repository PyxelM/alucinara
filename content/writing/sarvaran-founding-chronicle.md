## SCRIPTURA EX MUNDO PRAE ET POST FRACTO
### Chapter 1
1 Before Lunuth had first sprouted, before it had been ground into flour or baked into bread, the first Judge and the second Judge ruled the cosmos. 2 But the cosmos was destitute and shapeless, and the Judges existed to give the cosmos beauty and form. 3 Now the second Judge was subordinate to the first, giving counsel but not allowed by the first to decree the laws of nature itself. 4 And so the second Judge said to the first, 'the cosmos must be given shape.'

5 Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that the cosmos must be given shape, and from the void emerged dust and water, 6 and the Judges decreed that the dust and water should collect in lands and seas, and that the smaller lands should orbit the larger land. 7 It was also decreed that the seas should collect on the smaller lands. 8 But the Judges could not see their creation, and thus the second judge said, 'we must create a light, so that we may see our creation.'

9 Hearing this, the first Judge decreed that a light may be created, and from the larger land emerged flames bright enough that they should see their entire creation. 10 And so the second Judge named the light, 'Sun,' and the smaller lands, 'planets,' and the even smaller lands, 'moons.'

11 Now the second Judge was covetous of the first Judge's authority, saying, 'why should my superior decree all things, and I counsel my superior? Is not the beauty that has been created my own, for I have decided it?' 12 And so the second Judge hid from the first in secret, and decreed new laws that ordained the making of living spirits. 13 Now these spirits were hidden from the light, and so the second named the spirits 'Darkness.'

14 And the Darkness asked the second Judge, 'O glorious, may you please fill us, that we may not be dishonourably hungry, and that our hunger may not dishonour you?' 15 And so the second Judge gave the Darkness dust to eat, but the Darkness was not filled, saying, 'O glorious, do you mean to dishonour us further? Fill us with something that should match your glory, that we may be a testament to it.' 16 And so the second Judge gave the darkness a moon to eat, but the Darkness was not filled, saying, 'O glorious, you dishonour yourself if you are to suppose that this matches your glory! Fill us with something greater.' 17 And so the second Judge gave the darkness a planet to eat, but the Darkness was not filled.

18 Now the Darkness did not fear judgement, as it was hidden. 19 Distrusting its creator, it saw it well to consume other things, and thus began to eat other moons, other planets, and to drink seas, till there was nothing left but the Sun and the Judges. 20 Now the first Judge was horrified by the devestation that had been unleashed by the Darkness, saying to its companion, 'why have you created these spirits? Do you not know it dishonours you to destroy the cosmos we gave shape to? I will surely have to destroy these spirits, lest they destroy the cosmos at last.' 21 But the Darkness, hearing that it should be destroyed, set itself against the first Judge, to consume it.

22 But the first Judge battled the Darkness, decreeing that each spirit should be returned to the cosmos as what it had consumed. 23 Now the advantage of the Darkness was too great, and the Judge could not see it well. And it came to pass that the Darkness defeated the Judge, and consumed it. 24 But the power of the first Judge was too great, even in death, and many of the spirits of Darkness were destroyed, as was the cosmos shattered into pieces.

25 And so the surviving spirits of Darkness asked, 'O glorious, are we not now a testament to your glory?' But the Judge was ashamed of the consequences of its actions, 26 and its heart was set against the Darkness, saying, 'surely, you will not defeat me as you have consumed my companion.' And the Darkness said, 'yes, for you are glorious.' 27 But the Judge wept, saying, 'my companion was right, you were never to be the one testament to my glory, but rather this cosmos of our design. 28 I see now that you lack glory, whether filled or hungry, and your existence will forever shine unfavourably upon me. And so I will punish us for our iniquity.' 29 And the Darkness was afraid, saying, 'Do you intend to destroy us?' And the Judge said, 'I cannot destroy, but I will create a new punishment.' 30 And the Judge named this new punishment, 'hurt.'
### Chapter 2
1 And thus the cosmos was shattered, and it came to pass that the Judge decreed new laws of nature to punish the spirits of Darkness. 2 It was decreed for the spirits to reside within bodies bound by laws of pain, injury, disease, wear, and death.

3 The Judge named these spirits, 'living beings,' and 'men,' and the remnants of the old cosmos, 'realms.' 4 But some spirits had gained great power in their consumption of the old cosmos, and resisted the new laws. These became known, not by the Judge, but by men, as 'gods.'
