## Premise
The story is foremost about the romance between two Sarvaran minikin, the young Ibusa (also known as Bibu) and Madairh (also known as Mada). Madairh is a noblewoman, and Ibusa a peasant man; their love is at first forbidden, but Madairh finally takes him as her husband after she (and Ibusa) comes to age.
### Scene 1
The story begins when they meet in a Sarvaran market, where Ibusa is selling vegetables for his father, and Madairh is walking through the thoroughfare collecting taxes from the vendors. Madairh is immediately struck with love by the boy, and demands less money of him and his father. Bibu is struck by her kind deed and doesn't forget her, mentioning the pretty lady to his best friend, Ounoph.
### Scene 2
The next scene features Bibu's father talking to his wife about their boy's crush, and how he has been distracted while working in the field, chasing random ladies who walk along the nearby path in the hope that they're Madairh. Bibu's mother figures that he'll get over it eventually, and that it's a shame he's caught feelings for a noblewoman he can't have.
