## Chapter 1

Woodlice, dirt, and leaves. These were the first things little Blueberry saw when he woke up. This environment he had found himself in seemed like a poor imitation of what he was used to, which was a constant supply of cucumber and the fibreglass tree stump he called home - but this wasn't his home, this was something else.

As Blueberry got up, the first thing he noticed other than the lice, dirt, and leaves was a small raspberry which almost felt like a relief to see as it was Blueberry's favourite food, with a note next to it written in some other language he didn't know.

Slowly enjoying his raspberry, Blueberry started to realise his predicament. This was not a dream as he had first thought, but is a serious situation - one which he didn't have a full grasp of. Having finished his final bite of the berry, Blueberry walked onward in an attempt to figure out where he was, or why he had even been abandoned from his old life, sleeping inside the fibreglass tree stump, which itself was inside a glass terrarium of sorts.

Trawling along a path, which was cloaked by an interconnected net of brambles and leaves, Blueberry began to get emotional, sitting atop a pebble, quietly sobbing to himself. He missed his tree-stump, he missed his cucumber. Knowing that he doesn't know his way home, the little guy looked around, sobbing harder than before, and that was when he saw a sparkle come from the heavens.

Not trusting his eyes, Blueberry blinked rubbed his tears away, and noticed it again - it was unmistakably a sprinkle of iridescent dust coming from above. Having stopped crying, Blueberry asked who was there, his voice hoarse.

"Haha," a small but mellifluous voice called out, "It's, uh, me."  
Blueberry was quite confused, not having heard a voice of such quality before. "And who might you be?" he responded, his eyebrow raised.  
"I am the stool under which the toad sits, the shoe in which which the lady lives." The voice cryptically rang out.  
"So... your name is Toadstool?" Blueberry asked inquisitively.  
"I am the sun and the moon, the-" The voice was cut off by Blueberry, who grumpily called out "Cut the nonsense, Lad."  
"Well if you're gonna act like that... Alright. My name might as well be Toadstool." It said, slowly fluttering down to reveal its appearance.

Toadstool seemed to be a fairy, adorned with pastel blue hair and green clothes with flowers tucked in each pocket. "I'm a fairy." Toadstool proclaimed, his hair fluttering against his pointy ears. Dumbstruck by the fairy's appearance, Blueberry stammered as he replied. "I... am Blueberry." He said, holding his hand out introductorily.

Shaking Blueberry's hand gleefully, Toadstool smiled and replied. "Booberry... huh. Strange name." Having misheard Blueberry. "No-" Blueberry tried to reply, cut off by Toadstool's hasty attempts to drag him deeper into where they were.

"Come on Booberry, if you're here in the wild ya gotta know you way around!" Toadstool gleefully said, grabbing Blueberry's hand and dragging him off to someplace new. Blueberry, startled by being dragged from his rocky perch, noticed that Toadstool's hand was covered in the same iridescent dust that he has seen earlier when Toadstool was above him.

Blueberry didn't expect Toadstool's hand to feel as comfortable as it did, but that may have been because the both of them were flying. As they drifted through the air, Blueberry started to find it hard to focus on the sadness of being away from his home and, surprisingly, he was okay with that. The only thing on his mind was that he was flying.

Blueberry had never flown before, on account of the fact that he was particularly slimy and sluggish, so this experience was very new to him and he didn't know what to make of it other than the feelings he already knew, such as touch, smell, and sight. Although he had a hard time understanding what was in front of him, he still tried to keep a smile on his face as he looked at Toadstool.

"Cool Scenery, huh?" Toadstool said, looking onward.  
"Scenery? All I've known is my home." Blueberry responded, reflecting on his old tree stump.  
"Um... Do you not know what scenery is...?" Toadstool uttered incredulously.  
Blueberry tried to answer, his forefinger outstretched, but found that he couldn't muster a response. After a moment of silence only broken by the wind rushing past them, Blueberry managed to reply; "I can't truthfully describe what I'm seeing right now."

"Really? You don't know what a pond is? Or a tree?" Toadstool said after a pause saturated with thoughts.  
"I know what water is, or what leaf is. Just not a pond, nor a tree; a tree stump, however..." Blueberry replied, thinking about the features of his life.  
"Well, a pond is a big collection of water. Y'know, the clear stuff, and leaves grow on trees which're big planty structures." Toadstool replied. Blueberry didn't, as he had nothing much to say, but this was quickly alleviated by Toadstool shouting out loud - "Hey, we're almost above Morelland!"  
Almost startled by Toadstool's outburst, Blueberry quickly responded with "Uh... Where?"  
"Uh, there!" Toadstool replied, pointing to a colony of mushrooms next to a pond.  
Blueberry knew what mushrooms were, as they were a rare but delightful foodstuff he'd be given at times, but he didn't think they would be deserving of the title, "-Land."  
"Those little things? You're making me hungry, man." He said, as he and Toadstool veered to the left and downward, nearing the area.

As Blueberry and Toadstool landed, Blueberry recoiled at the fairy's fluttering wings as they came to a stop. With both their feet on the ground, Blueberry let go of Toadstool's hand, revealing that he had been given his own fair share of iridescent dust from Toadstool's hand, which he quickly brushed off against a clump of green moss.

"This is Morland...?" Blueberry asked, mispronouncing the name since he was unimpressed with the lack of infrastructure.  
"No, have you ever been out in the wild befo... oh yeah, you haven't!" Toadstool hastily replied, only halfway through realising that yes - his newfound acquaintance hadn't been out in the wild, (of course, except for his enclosure.)  
"It seems you've more experience than I'd have thought, though; you've already opened an Ālūcinārī Gateway." He added, noting the flowing spiral emitting a full array of colours behind Blueberry. Blueberry jumped as he noticed it, surprised by the glowing whirl of hues which was coming from the moss.

"I wouldn't put it past you to jump, but it was you who did conjure it." Toadstool mentioned, patting Blueberry on the back.  
"I didn't make it - I... I just brushed the dust on my hand against some moss." Blueberry responded, visibly disturbed by the sight.  
"Not the first time I've seen someone get so perturbed by an Ālū' Gateway, I'm gonna need to to listen to me close if you wanna see the entirety of Morelland." Toadstool said, looking Blueberry straight in the eyes as he took a small pouch out of one of his many pockets.

"Gateways can be an extremely difficult thing to get through, but eventually, everyone gets through." He added, wrapping a small blue velvet cloth he took from the pouch around his arm. "Grab onto my arm, and just follow my lead."

The two of them stepped in, Blueberry meekly hiding behind Toadstool. As the spiral engulfed them, Blueberry couldn't help but feel the immense forces upon him as he felt his essence float around like a butterfly - leaving his body and re-entering like a sheepish firefly. Round and round and round the two of them went within the Ālūcinārī Gateway, and as the transportation reached it's zenith, Blueberry found it hard to stay conscious, and eventually, scared he may let go of Toadstool, fainted.
