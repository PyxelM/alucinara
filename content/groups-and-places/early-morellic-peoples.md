## Overview
The early Morellic peoples were nomadic, tribal groups living in the south of Tseireph during the minikin Neolithic era, or late stone age. They were united by a common culture, language, and race, but lacked organisation and centralisation. 

The early Morellic people served as the predecessors of [Sarvara](groups-and-places/sarvara.md) and [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md), and spoke a continuum of Proto-Morellic dialects, including Old Sarvaran and Old Corothic.

They were contemporary with the pre-aqhoran peoples, but would not make contact with them until they migrated to the southern coast of Tseireph and founded the city-state of Aqhor at the dawn of the minikin Bronze age.
## Clothing Practices
The early Morellic peoples wore clothes made of animal hide, fur, leather, woven grass leaves, and plant fibre, such as from Lunuth. They would commonly wear long dress-like tunics, cloaks, belts with pouches, sandals, and jewellery made of bones, shells, volcanic glass, and stones[^2].

They would not wear more sophisticated fabrics until the bronze age saw great developments in agriculture, namely the domestication of Lunuth wheat and invention of Lunuth fabric. They would sew their hide and leaves together using bone needles and plant fibre, and would commonly dye their clothing colours such as red or orange.
## Religion
The early Morellic religion was decentralised, [angel](deities/the-angels)-worshipping, and polytheistic. The early Morellic Minikin would make prayers, sacrifice, and worship to these deities, whom they could communicate with in dreams. Each tribe, clan, family would have patron deities who were believed to have a level of influence over the good fortune of their worshippers.

The chief deity of the early Morellic religion was the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), who protected the early Morellic peoples for their faith. It was believed that the petrified child was the firstborn of the god of nature, known as 'Kherelli[^1],' and that the other deities were her other children.
