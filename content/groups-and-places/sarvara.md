## Overview
Sarvara (Sarvaran: '*Sarvárą*' IPA: `/sar.vá.rã/`) was a Morellic city state and civilisation in the Sarvaran river basin, southern [Tseireph](groups-and-places/tseireph.md). Sarvara was founded during the Minikin Neolithic era, reaching its height during the Bronze Age, and was one of the first great cities, alongside [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md) and [Aqhor](groups-and-places/aqhor.md). It held a great amount of influence over the river basin, and served as the foundation for its successor state, the Empire of the Petrified Child.
## Etymology
The name for the city, '*Sarvárą*,' is made up of two roots, '*Sarav*,' the name of a river, and '*Rą*,' meaning 'City \[of].' The name of the river Sarav was loaned into Old Sarvaran from Old Diiran, a native non-Morellic language.
## Location
Sarvara was built on the Sarav river in the Sarvaran river basin, which was in southern Tseireph, a continent of Qherelh in the 2nd Realm. It had a mediterranean climate, with seasonal floods from the river. Aqhor was to the south, and Coroth to the northeast.

## History
Sarvara was founded and built up by Clan Sarav of the [Early Morellic tribes](groups-and-places/early-morellic-tribes.md), who migrated into the basin from the east and settled down.

Some notable historical figures include:
- Meadow the Old[^1], the city's first ruling Matriarch
- The Elephant, an early warrior-priest who won a great battle
- Snowflower, an early cartographer and innovator of the Sarvaran logography
## Calendar
The date of the city's founding serves as year 0 of the Sarvaran calendar, which was one of the many innovations made by the Sarvaran Minikin. Other notable innovations included pottery, poetry, art, early mass-production, war, and cartography.
