## Overview
Sarvara was a Morellic city state, civilisation, and culture. It held a great amount of influence during the minikin Bronze age, and served as the foundation for it's successor state, the Empire of the Petrified Child. Sarvara was preceded by the [early Morellic nomads](groups-and-places/early-morellic-tribes.md)' tribal settlements.

The date of the city's founding serves as year 0 of the Sarvaran calendar, which was one of the many innovations made by the Sarvaran Minikin. Other notable innovations included pottery, poetry, art, early mass-production, war, and cartography.
