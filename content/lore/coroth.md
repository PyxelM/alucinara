## Overview
Coroth was a Morellic city state founded in the Minikin Neolithic Era. It preceeded the Corothic Republic, a nation that would greatly influence the surrounding regions including the Empire of the Petrified Child, which succeeded [Sarvara](lore/sarvara.md).
## Etymology
The name 'Coroth' comes from Ancient Corothic, and descends from the Proto-Morellic root \*Kyolot. Coroth was the name of an early Morellic clan, after whom the city state and the river it was founded upon would be named.
## History
Coroth was founded by the Coroth clan of early Morellic minikin. After Sarvara had been settled by the Mora clan, the Coroth migrated independently into the Sarvaran River Basin, settling directly to the northeast of the Sarvaran territories.
## Exports
Coroth's main export was Corothic blue, a pigment used in artwork and dyeing, which was extracted from the native Water Dragons of the river Coroth, a tributary of the river Sarav. Coroth also pioneered the agriculture and trade of fruits and berries, contrasting Sarvara's industry of Lunuth Wheat, and Aqhor's of Sweetrice.
