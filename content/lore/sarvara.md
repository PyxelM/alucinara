## Overview
Sarvara (Sarvaran: '*Sarvárą*' IPA: `/sar.vá.rã/`) was a Morellic city state and a civilisation whose society, territory, and culture extended beyond its original city walls. The Sarvaran city and civilisation were located within the Sarvaran river basin, of southern [Tseireph](lore/tseireph.md), of the [2nd Realm](lore/2nd-realm.md).

Sarvara was founded during the Minikin Neolithic era, reaching its height during the Bronze Age, and was one of the first great cities, alongside [Coroth](groups-and-places/coroth.md) and [Aqhor](groups-and-places/aqhor.md). It held a great amount of influence over the river basin, and served as the foundation for its successor state, the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/the-empire-of-the-petrified-child.md).
## Etymology
The name for the city, '*Sarvárą*,' is made up of two roots, '*Sarav*,' the name of a river, and '*Rą*,' meaning 'City \[of].' The name of the river Sarav was loaned into Old Sarvaran from Old Diiran, a native non-Morellic language.
## Location
Sarvara was built on the Sarav river in the Sarvaran river basin, which was in southern Tseireph, a continent of Qherelh in the 2nd Realm. It had a mediterranean climate, with seasonal floods from the river. Aqhor was to the south, and Coroth to the northeast.

## History
Sarvara was founded and built up by the [Early Morellic tribes](lore/early-morellic-tribes.md), who migrated into the basin from the east and settled down.

Some notable historical figures include:
- Babymeadow the Old, the city's first ruling high-matriarch
- The Elephant, an early warrior who won a great battle
- Snowleaf, an early cartographer and innovator of the Sarvaran logography.
## Caste System
The sarvaran caste system was divided into 5 hereditary castes, derived from the early Morellic cultural structure, which then became reinforced by taboos and the organisation that came with the advent of the Bronze Age.
### High-Matriarchs
The highest role in Sarvaran society was that of high-matriarchs, queen-like figures who ruled states. However, despite transcending the caste heirarchy, high matriarchs were not a caste in and of themselves, and were counted among the nobles.
### Priests
The highest caste was the priests, who could be of any gender. This caste was derived from the spiritual leaders of the early Morellic tribes, and the duties of the priests were of celibacy, worship, and sacrifice. They led sermons in the temples.
### Nobles
The second highest caste was the nobles; this caste was earned through honor and age; almost all matriarchs and their husbands were nobles. The nobles often owned land and employed vassals, mostly other nobles and commoners, to live and work there.
### Warriors
The third highest were the warriors. They descended from the early spiritual leaders as well as the priests, but rather focussed more on protection and sorcery rather than pastoral care and worship. They were often seen as dispensible and replaceable, and systemically mistreated, leading to their place in the heirarchy.
### Commoners
The second lowest caste was the commoners. They were the laypeople and workers, vassals of the nobles, and made up the majority of the population in Sarvaran society. They were farmers, builders, smiths, and artists.
### Wretched
The lowest caste was the wretched. These were the least in Sarvaran society, those with diseases such as leprosy, those who were dishonoured, and those who had commited social crimes such as treason. The wretched often lived outside of city walls, within primitive and basal communities.
## Calendar
The date of the city's founding serves as year 0 of the Sarvaran calendar, which was one of the many innovations made by the Sarvaran Minikin. Other notable innovations included pottery, poetry, art, early mass-production, war, and cartography.
