## Overview
In this note, I will describe the canonical creation story. In-world, it is believed by the [Morellic Minikin](groups/morellic-minikin.md), but was diverged from or was abandoned by many other groups who believe other stories. It features the tale behind the First and Second Judges, and eventually the emergence of Life.

## Events
At first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The void was wholly empty, except for two spirits, the First Judge and the Second. The judges were created by nothing but for the inherent obligation of creating beauty.

The first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they created the universe with the aim to make it beautiful with the help of the forces.
### The Forces
There were initially two spiritual forces, through which the universe operated;
- The first force, Nature, would give the universe form and order, resulting in the existence of matter, temperature, gravity, etc.
- The second force, Truth, allowed the universe to stay consistent, following true rules that could never be broken.

Stars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which served to create beauty, but a somber kind of beauty. The universe was beautiful, yes, but no living thing could call it home. The universe wasn't designed for inhabitants.
### Life
However, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create a force all of its own; *life*. This third force created a spiritual essence known as Darkness, which fed upon the material of the universe, destroying all in its path.
### A Dark Mistake
The Darkness immediately grew disproportionate in power once it had fed upon nebulae and galaxies, thriving under the laws of nature that weren't built to restrict it. Eventually, it grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the First Judge once the last star was gone.

The First Judge was furious when it had discovered the Darkness, disgusted and mortified that the essence had taken the horrifying purpose of feeding upon and destroying the beauty of the created universe.

The judges immediately clashed with Darkness, which attempted to feed upon them. The two other forces were employed in all of their power to combat the effects of Life; but it was no use.
### The Battle
Attempting to fight off the Darkness, the Second Judge completely overhauled the laws of nature, changing the way in which the force of Truth worked, creating the Second Laws of Nature. The First Judge likewise defended itself, creating the new force of Magic, which allowed the First Laws to live on as well as the second.
#### Second Laws of Nature and Magic
The second laws of nature caused the forces to require physical form. This led to the manifestation of the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md), the [Golden Ape](deities/the-golden-ape.md), Alucinarium, and Hydrocarbons.

[Alucinara](deities/alucinara.md) was the energy through which Magic operated, and Alucinarium the physical material to contain it. Likewise, [Darkness](deities/the-darkness.md) was the energy through which Life operated, and Hydrocarbons the physical material to contain it too. 

Upon the combination of Darkness and Alucinara, the Soul is created. The Soul is what allows living beings to act and think.
## Aftermath
### The Shattering of the Realms
The universe was greatly weakened by the shockwave created in the First Judge's death; The explosion created would later be known as the Big Bang or the Supernova, which caused the universe to shatter into thousands of realms.
### Beauty
'Beauty' as a quality of the universe was originally defined by the Judges but, once they were destroyed, it became an inherent aspect of the universe; it is not necessarily a definition of how 'beautiful' something may be in the human sense of the word, but rather how close it comes in aesthetic to the universe pre-shattering.

Alucinara, as it enforces the [First Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md), causes anything it affects to become more alike the old universe, unless it is unstable. The most beautiful realms are the most alucinara-rich, but so are the least beautiful, as they have the least stable Alucinara energy.
### The Realms
99% of all realms became empty and inaccessible; these disintegrated from their instability into the void-space between all stable realms. In the end, only 7 realms remained. Three infra-essent realms, one non-essent realm, and 3 ultra-essent realms.
#### Essence
All lasting realms were defined by a quality known as 'essence.' This term describes the beauty of the realms, the least beautiful realms being the most 'infra-essent' and the most beautiful being the most 'ultra-essent.'

The 0th realm was virtually unaffected by Alucinara outside of the supernova, and thus is described as non-essent. The ultra-essent realms are the most fantastical, influenced the most by stable Alucinara, and the infra-essent realms are the most morose, influenced the most by unstable Alucinara.
#### Alucinara Gateways
A method of traversing the realms was 'Alucinara Gateways.' These gateways were a type of portal, created through [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md), that allowed matter or energy to pass from one realm to another.

Some limits are present in traversing realms however; it is the easiest to travel to the nearest or most co-essent realms; i.e. if one were in the 2nd Realm, it would require the least effort to create a gateway to the -2nd, 1st, or 3rd realms.
#### Essential shift
The term 'essential shift' describes the process that takes place when matter or energy travels across a realm. It most commonly occurs upon the use of an Alucinara Gateway, but there are other ways for it to occur.

For example, infra-essential shift is a symptom of Phantasmarrhoea, where one is involuntarily transported to one of the least beautiful realms at the most advanced stage of the curse. 

Furthermore, mass-essential shift took place when the Supernova reached Earth. It is the reason that the squirrels of the 0th realm entered the 2nd realm and developed into [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md).
### The Deities
As the forces were compelled to gain physical form through the second laws of nature, the resulting beings became known as the deities. This includes:
- [Alucinara](deities/alucinara.md)
- [The Darkness](deities/the-darkness.md)
- [The Golden Ape](deities/the-golden-ape.md)
- [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md)
### The Pond
The Second Laws of Nature resolved to banish the Darkness to the void-space between every realm known as the Pond, an afterlife (or 'outer' life) where the Darkness within a soul goes upon expiry or creation of a body.

Upon death, the Darkness will return to the Pond through [Frequencial Shift](phenomena/frequencial-shift). This can be circumvented with [soulstones](phenomena/soulstone.md), in which case the darkness will bind to the asphalt in the stone and remain outside of the Pond.

Darkness also appears outside of the Pond when impure. In these cases, it can be found in tar pits and bitumen, where it is combined in a mixture with other elements.
### The Laws of Nature
As the void-space had been emptied by the Darkness' destruction, life now had no chance of thriving there, in the Pond. The only way that it could live on was by feeding upon the last beauty contained within the realms.

The Second Laws, in tandem with the First, turned the Darkness from a devouring mass of evil into the magical souls that inhabit the quaint, sickly living beings that eat leaves, soil, and flesh.
## Species of the Realms
In every realm, many many species had developed. The species of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with Alucinara. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.
### The Supernova
In 80 [MyBS](lore/sarvaran-calendar.md), the shockwave created when the First Judge was destroyed had finally reached the Earth; the first supernova. As the Judge had created [alucinara](deities/alucinara.md) upon it's death, the supernova was rich in alucinara energy, resulting in the mass-essential shift of 1% of all matter affected.

There was virtually no destruction on that day, but the many living beings affected were now displaced. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into the essent realms from the 0th. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.
