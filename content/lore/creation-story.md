## Overview
In this note, I will describe the canonical creation story. In-world, it is believed by the [Morellic Minikin](groups/morellic-minikin.md), but was diverged from or was abandoned by many other groups who believe other stories. It features the tale behind the First and Second Judges, and eventually the emergence of Life.

## Events
At first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The void was wholly empty, except for two consciousnesses in the void, the First Judge and the Second. The judges were created by nothing and from nothing but a moral obligation to the universe, to create the laws of nature and form the infinity they call home into a masterpiece.

The first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they filled the void with light, designing planets, stars, elements, and designed each element their role in creation.

Stars glowed bright and planets shifted in form at a steady pace, all the result of the laws of nature which served to create beauty, but a somber kind of beauty. The universe was beautiful, yes, but no living thing could call it home. The universe wasn't designed for inhabitants.
### Life
However, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of its own; *life*.

Life was created in the form of the Darkness - a material made of thinking tar, a material hidden from light so that it would not be discovered. the Darkness immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the First Laws which weren't built to restrict it.

the Darkness founded organisations, guilds, and empires that fed on the newly diminishing universe, sucking energy out of the planets and stars it lived on and beside. It greedily ate constellations, galaxies, and superclusters, so that it could spread and continue to go undiscovered in the void.
### A Dark Mistake
However, it eventually grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the First Judge once the last star was gone.

The First Judge was furious when it had discovered the Darkness, disgusted and mortified that matter could behave and take reality for its own means for the horrifying purpose of feeding upon and destroying the beauty of the created universe.
### The Shattering of the Realms
the Darkness, in its overwhelmingly massive quantity, went to subsume the First Judge. The Judge exerted the forces of creation a thousand times over to push them away, but it was of no use against the greedy, ever hungry, mass.

Greatly weakened, The Judge's hand slipped as it continued to push away the Darkness, and in a moment the universe swiftly broke into thousands upon thousands of shards, each one now a realm, each with it's own perverse spot in the order of the shattered universe.
## Aftermath
### The Laws of Nature
Terrified, the Second Judge sacrificed itself, turning itself into the [Second Laws of Nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a vain attempt to save its companion. These new laws served to impose restrictions on the Darkness, and only affected the realms, the last places with energy and matter, all of which was left over from the Shattering.

And in the First Judge's last moments, it turned itself into [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), a form of energy that allowed the First Laws to exist in place of the Second. This meant that the beauty the judge had created could still exist, and the Darkness could also live on.

As the void-space had been emptied by the Darkness' destruction, life had no chance of thriving there. The only way that it could live on was by feeding upon the last beauty contained within the realms.

The Second Laws, in tandem with the First, turned the Darkness from a devouring mass of evil into the magical souls that inhabit the quaint, sickly living beings that eat leaves, soil, and flesh.
### The Pond
The Second Laws of Nature resolved to banish the Darkness to the lowliest places in every realm left, tarpits and black holes,  and to the border between every realm, which was later termed by the minikin as the [Pond](locations/pond.md).

The Pond was named for its appearance, being an all-encompassing inky mass of liquid tar. It took up the infinite void-space in between and surrounding every realm, the only place left that Darkness could live unaided by [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md).

It was the only place left that Darkness could live and inhabit unaided, as it was the last remnant of the old universe still governed by the first laws of nature.
#### The Soul
Darkness now took the form of Hydrocarbons, the building blocks of life. This meant that Darkness could continue to live, but there were restrictions: Life was now made up of three ingredients;
- Darkness
- Alucinara
- and a body.

This level of restriction was incomprehensible to the Darkness of the old world, but the restrictions now meant that Darkness could never destroy reality like it had in the past any further.

When all ingredients have come together, the Darkness takes control of the body, allowing it to move, act, manipulate objects, conceptualise, philosophise, and *be* the Darkness in living form. But due to the restrictions of the body, every living being can succumb to injury, age, famine, disease, and will always succumb to death in the end.
#### Death, and the Pond
Without all three ingredients, the Darkness is simply unmoving, unthinking, and static. When inhabiting any unsuitable body, such as a corpse, the Darkness immediately tries to take the path of least resistance to the Pond once more.

When darkness doesn't return to the Pond, this is because the Darkness is simply inhabiting a body. For example, tar pits can exist on planetary bodies, as the Darkness is inhabiting the applicable planet, and organic compounds can exist in living beings, as the Darkness is inhabiting a living being.
### The Realms
Following the shattering, each realm was ordered according to stability. The realm known as the 0th was fully stable, positioned at the centre of the Pond. The next realms, the co-essent[^1] 1st and -1st, were placed on opposite sides of the 0th and, going outward, each realm following the last was positioned in a clock-wise spiral shape around the centre.

Going further from the centre, each realm would become more susceptible to the influence of [Alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md). For example, the 

%%In the universe's final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more susceptible to the effects of the [First Laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md).

One could shift from realm to realm by creating [Alucinara gateways](phenomena/alucinara-gateway), the process getting more Alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.%%
## Hierarchy of Beings
[See Main Article Here](lore/heirarchy-of-beings.md)
## Species of the Realms
In every realm, many many species had developed. The species of the 0th realm had developed and arose with little to no knowledge or experience at all with Alucinara. That is, until a supernova had blasted the Earth with it.
### The Supernova of 80 MyBS
In 80 [MyBS](lore/sarvaran-calendar.md), the shockwave of a far-off supernova had finally reached the Earth. The star that had caused it was extremely old, having retained a lot of Alucinara from the energy left over from the shattering of the realms.

There was virtually no destruction on that day, but the main outcome was mass-frequencial shift of the animals and plants affected. In the blink of an eye, masses of creatures were dispersed into different realms. A lot of them went on to be hunted by the native predators, leading to the rapid need for evolution.
