#### Religious Music
Sarvaran religious music took the form of an orchestra of three groups; the Singers, the Whistlers, and the Drummers, who would all perform on religious holidays and during evening worship every day.

##### Tuning
Sarvaran religious music followed a handful of tuning systems, but the majority of songs followed [an altered form of 8-TET](https://sevish.com/scaleworkshop/?n=8%20Almost-Equal%20Divisions&l=5k._8c._ci._fa._ku._p0._rs._xc.&c=~-~~-~~-&f=b4&a=3&y=1hr&s=0&r=bv&version=2.1.0). Other common systems were Equipentatonic and 6-TET.

##### Orchestra Layout
The singers would gather in a large group at the front of the stage, the whistlers at the back in a group around half the size as the previous, and the drummers would gather in two groups, half the size of the whistlers, at each side of the singers.

##### Singers
The singers would form the melodic foundation of each song, chanting polyphonically, harmonising with eachother. They would often take their lyrics from the epic stories that defined Sarvaran mythology.

They would not use [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) to add effects to their voices, as legibility was key to getting across the story of each song they were to play.

##### Whistlers
The whistlers would form the main lead of each song, using overtone singing to create loud, high-pitched tones that would ring out about the temple.

The whistlers would use alucinara to alter the timbre of their singing, introducing audio effects like tremelo by altering the air pressure in their mouths.

##### Drummers
The drummers would beat drums along to the song, forming the rhythmic foundation of each song. Their purpose was to introduce an element to the song reminiscent of natural chaos, and would often reflect the song's themes in their intensity and rhythm.
