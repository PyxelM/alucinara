## Creation
At first, there was an inky void stretching on for eternity. The material of the void was Darkness, a pitch-black substance made of hydrocarbons. There were two consciousnesses in the void, the first Judge and the second, who existed to create the universe.

The first judge helmed the operation, designing the [laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md) and giving the green light to the second judge's every suggestion. Together, they cleared the void of darkness, designed planets, stars, elements, and each their roles in the universe.

### Life
However, the second judge began to deviate from the first's plan. Motivated by envy for control, it attempted to create something all of their own; *life*. Life was created in the form of the Darklings - creatures made of darkness, hidden from light so that they would not be discovered.

The darklings immediately grew disproportionate in power, thriving under the natural laws not built for them. They built empires founded on the backs of planets, and sucked the light out of stars for energy, so that the darkness could spread, and so that they could continue to go undiscovered.

### Darklings' Mistake
Eventually, the darklings grew cocky, and attempted to harvest the energy of the first judge once the last star was gone. The first judge was furious when it had discovered them, disgusted and mortified that matter could move and take reality for its own interests, never to aid nature.

In an apocalyptic turn of events, the first judge shattered the walls of reality as it tried in vain to push off the darklings, and it was unfortunately subsumed by the mass of living darkness.

## Aftermath
Almost immediately, the second judge created the [second laws of nature](phenomena/natural-laws/second-laws.md) in a last-ditch attempt to save its companion, but it was too late, and only served to worsen the shattered new reality. In the first judge's last moments, it turned itself [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), an infinite form of energy that would allow the first laws to live on within the second laws, allowing its legacy to continue.

### The Darklings
It also banished the darklings to the void-space that surrounded every small bubble of reality left. It defined their place in the universe, that they would never be able to destroy the world unfettered once more. Without alucinara energy, that would bring the first laws of nature back into effect, the darklings would be rendered a simple tar - with no thoughts and no intentions, a product of the second laws.

The first judge resolved to turn their existence into some good - it had created the *soul*.

### The Soul
The Darklings were then turned into Souls, which are Darkness under effects of Alucinara. It was created so that the darklings could only touch reality by fuelling the good of an innocent creature, and could never do anything without the limits of a biochemical host.

The soul could only manifest as amino acids, or other organic compounds such as tar, when in contact with alucinara. This is what gives organisms such as animals and plants life - the amino acids in their bodies interacts with aluicnara to create thought and intention.

Without alucinara, darklings would only appear as organic compounds *without* the capacity for thought, as the second laws of nature weren't built to perpetuate the soul. They often appear as the natural substance tar, being given their own place in the universe such as in tar pits and resin.

### The Realms
In the universe's final form, alucinarium content would increase as one got further from the 0th realm, as these would be the most unstable and more succeptible to the effects of the [first laws](phenomena/natural-laws/first-laws.md).

One could shift from realm to realm by creating [alucinara gateways](phenomena/alucinara-gateway), the process getting more alucinara-consumptive and difficult as one progressed further from the centre. It is practically impossible to surpass the 3rd and -3rd realms with this method, despite the amount of realms being practically infinite.
