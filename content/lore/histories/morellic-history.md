## The Mora Tribe
The Mora were a nomadic pastoralist tribe with fair skin and hairy extremeties. The inhabited the northern humid continental forests of [Tséireph](lore/locations/tseireph.md), a region known as 'Áyaséywą,' or 'The Riverland,' named after the confluence of the Rivers Avműrą and Káyaweh.
### Early Agriculture
Early agriculture is evidenced in the eastern Riverland, at the delta of the river Káyaweh, in a smaller region with a mediterranean climate known as the 'Áyasúmesith;' Many cities cropped up in this region.

The first crops to be farmed by the Morellic minikin were:
- Lunúth, similar to wheat - used in the creation of a bread known as Lúnutsárri, or Lunuthbread.
- Omű̂, similar to flax - used in the creation of early clothing as a fabric known as 'Oműyasen,' a staple material in early textiles.
- Nyútwárą plants, similar to strawberry plants - harvested for their berries of the same name and their leaves used in Nyuta Tea.
- Sarkïtwárą plants, similar to orange and banana plants, a member of the citron family - harvested for their segmented fruit of the same name and deadly leaves used in poison.

Furthermore, certain animals began to be domesticated and / or farmed, including;
- Eimésewïdh, similar to silkworms - an insect farmed for it's silk known as 'Ewi̋dasen,' generally a higher-quality, more expensive fabric compared to Oműyasen.
