The history of the Morellic [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) is long, beginning with the Mora tribe.
## The Mora Race
The Mora were a race of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md), subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.

By their peak, the Mora held 6 tribes of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these tribes was the Sewi, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.
## The Sewi Tribe
The Sewi, led by a matriarch known as Dilvîdh, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.

The largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the Mora; a city known as Endîrun, meaning 'city of farms,' built upon the annually-flooding river Erücâs, meaning 'river of the east,' in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.
## The Sewi Civil War
However, the stability of the Sewi was thrown into question upon Dilvîdh's death. Her eldest, the disabled matriarch Viga, was assassinated by the command of her sibling Ferna, who thought that she was better suited to rule.

This led to a bloody civil war, causing the decimation of the Sewi population. Two tribes split off; the Lantâna, led by Dilvîdh's now eldest, Wírildh, and the Djerâya, led by Ferna. The two began to fight for matriarchal power over the Sewi.
### The Battle over the Erücâs
In a battle fought over the river Erücâs, the Djerâya were flanked from the west by the Lantâna military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.

The battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of Djerâya minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lantâna victorious, the Djerâya were defeated, but the battle left Endîrun inhospitable, run-down, and littered with [Baby Meadows](deities/the-petrified-child.md).
## Proliferation of the Northeast
While the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river Erücâs caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lantâna's part.

Having received prophecy of a famine, Wírildh made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lantâna and Djerâya, to the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.

This was a success, initially; the Lantâna built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of Endîrun to the west, known as New Endîrun. There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other Mora tribes moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.

In addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the Mora minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Hanyârï.
### The Famine
Despite the Lantâna's efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from [The Mother Tree](deities/mother-tree.md) to punish the Lantâna for preparing with such violence.

The total population of the Mora halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving Djerâya minikin attempted to take over the Lantâna once more.
## The Yu'aha
Following the loss over the Erücâs, the surviving Djerâya fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lantâna and sympathetic Mora in the neighbouring nation of the Yu'aha tribe to the west.

Motivated by racism and jealousy, the Yu'aha, led by the patriarch Ero'u and his vizier Arêven (Ferna's grand-daughter, the new Djerâya matriarch), passed east over the river Koyhots against the Lantâna.
### The Weakening of the Lantâna
The Yu'aha didn't take to raiding cities such as New Endîrun, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lantâna's territory. These settlements were the nation's main source of food, especially those built on the Erücâs.

The Yu'aha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lantâna farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lantâna, and made them dependent on the hostile Yu'aha for the little food in the area left.
### Arêven's Plans
Unbeknownst to Ero'u, his vizier Arêven was rounding the Djerâya and their mercenaries against the Lantâna, with the intent to attack New Endîrun and genocide the Lantâna in their weakened state.

While the Yu'aha were concerned with oppressing and virtually enslaving the Lantâna, the Djerâya were concerned with complete annihilation - a prospect unappealing to the Yu'aha.

This was discovered by the Lantâna-sympathetic supreme priest of the Yu'aha, Rwenedh the Blind, whom was 1 quarter Lantâna. He, in secret, told the Lantâna matriarch Viga II (grand-daughter of Wirîldh) of the Djerâya's plans.
### Lantâna-Hanyârï League
Upon hearing of this, the Lantâna proposed a military alliance with the Hanyârï in order to fight the Djerâya upon the dawn of their genocidal campaign, which was accepted.

Letting the Djerâya continue in their plans, they waited for a direct attack, while massing an army of Hanyârï soldiers and Lantâna commanders. While the famine was chipping away at the Lantâna, the Hanyârï territory was still abundant in food, allowing the Djerâya to remain.
### Seige of New Endîrun
This direct attack came in the Siege of New Endîrun. Blindsided, the Yu'aha provided no support, and in fact executed every Djerâya official in power. Arêven and her generals were the only Djerâya nobles in power at this point, but their fiery hatred proved them unaffected by the response to their betrayal.

In the battle, the walls were broken down and trade routes disrupted. The League was able to hold off the Djerâya for a while, but the Lantâna eventually surrendered and fled the city in search of refuge.
## Migration of the Lantâna
Following the surrender of the Lantâna, a vast portion of their men were taken as slaves by the Djerâya. The rest resolved to travel south, returning to the nomadic lifestyle they had left behind in Endîrun.

The most of the men left were the disabled, those unworthy of labour, all of whom were euthanized as the Lantâna began to travel. Some were cannibalised to maximise food during the famine, which led to many retaliations from the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md).
### Arrival at the Lakes
Travelling from the steppe through the deserts, living as nomads, the tribe reached the equatorial saltwater lakes and the surrounding rainforests, now led by the matriarch Sourél (grand-daughter of Viga II.)
#### Geography
There were two lakes that divided the north of [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md) from the south, a larger lake to the west and a smaller to the east.

The Western lake, known as Eséribh, was home to the native Kastéirra race of minikin. The Kastéirra were divided into 3 main tribes, the Néth to the south, Veláni to the north, and Kîrlégh in the southeastern inner corner of the lake. 

The Eastern Lake, known as Anghôlï, was home to the Urűnnu race of minikin. The Urűnnu was made up of the Káuneph to the south and the Hanyârï to the north - a group the Lantâna had already met.
### Dispersion into Nearby areas
The Lantâna felt this was an opportune time to settle down once more, as the lakes provided a pseudo-maritime role reminiscent of the Endîrunic coasts. The largest Lantâna settlement built after the migration was known as Náirų, a port city on the inner southeastern corner of the lake Anghôlï. 

The Lantâna were largely peaceful with the natives, respecting their borders and customs, creating a healthy economic relationship.
## The Aurűk
Following years of cohabitation, some Lantâna and Kîrlégh Kastéirra hybridised, forming the new Aurűk tribe at their border, although some Kastéirra and Lantâna groups further from the border did not hybridise, and rather retained their earlier culture. The first Aurűk matriarch was known as Mǫ́th (Sourél's daughter.)
#### Appearance
The Aurűk were defined by their brown skin, bristly hair, and the fur that grew from their hands, feet, and extremities, resembling the Kastéirra minikin as well as the Mora.
#### Language
The Lantâna began to speak Old Sarvaran, a language developed from Proto-Morellic. The Aurűk dialect of Old Sarvaran developed into a pidgin, and eventually the Aurűk creole, influenced by the Kîrlégh superstrate dialect.
#### Religion
Having picked up many cultural practices throughout the Lantâna migration and merging with the Kastéirra, they also developed their own [unique religion](religion/auruk-religion.md).
### Conflict with Veláni
While the Aurűk retained healthy trade and diplomacy with these groups, the Veláni were violent, seeing this ethnic hybridisation as a sort of 'impurity.' The Veláni performed many raids on Aurűk settlements, with the eventuality that they should attempt to conquer Náirų.
### Aurűk-Veláni Borderland
Many border skirmishes occurred between the Aurűk and Veláni. This led to the creation of many Baby Meadows, which increased soil fertility, and thus the establishment of many farming towns.

Due to the volatile position of these towns, many guard posts were constructed in the canopy of the surrounding rainforest, on trees and guard towers. Due to the increased pressure from the Veláni, many advancements were made.
### Advancements in Defence and Offence
Some innovations were made in the field of archery and cavalry.

While minikin had previously hunted and battled by hurling pointy objects at each other through [alucinara](deities/alucinara.md), the Aurűk began to create specialised arrows. Arrows would be blessed with [symbols](phenomena/symbols.md) to create a certain effect, could now be kept within a quiver, and more than one could be shot at once.

In addition, they began to train some native mustelids known as War Weasels into aiding in battle. These War Weasels would learn to stay calm during a fight, and pay attention to cues from their rider into performing tactical movements, evasion, and war dances. Some war weasels would be blessed with symbolic brands.
## Veláni War

### Aftermath
## Founding of Sarvara, etc.
sarvara was south east of the lakes, neth was directly on them, and kaseirra was a hybrid of the kaseirrith and morellic minikin, to the east on the coast of the sarvaran gulf, to the north of sarvara.
