Minikin cities are different to human cities; rather than featuring houses built on the ground, Minikin would rather live in the canopy, using the height as a barrier against predators.

Urban minikin slept in hammocks amongst the tree branches, stored goods in clay shelters attached to the branches, and worshipped deities in clay temples on the ground.
