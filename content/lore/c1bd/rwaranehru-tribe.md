## Overview
The Rwaránehru[^1] tribe was unrelated to the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1BD/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe and the [Moráillona family](lore/c1BD/families/moraillona-family.md); in fact, they were the western natives of the equatorial lakes. They had a 3-gender system, and their rulers and higher class tended to be Neuter. The tribe became obsolete following their merging into the Neth tribe.

### Reputation
The Rwaránehru had a reputation of peacefulness, aquatic animal husbandry, and philosophy. While they were nonoffensive, not actively seeking new land to control, they were violently defensive and would do anything to protect their land.

### Culture
The Rwaránehru tribe adhered to a 3-gender system, Male, characterised by farming and physical labour, Female, characterised by childbearing and guiding, and Neuter, characterised by ruling and philosophical labour.

While other cultures sought to conquer other lands, the Rwaránehru sought to conquer the mind and the universe, explicitly through gaining more understanding of it. It was the Neuters' job to ponder this, as males and females were expected to actively participate in their society.
