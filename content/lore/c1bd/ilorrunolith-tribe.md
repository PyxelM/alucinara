## Overview
The Ilorrų́nolith[^1] tribe was the group of minikin native to the south preceding the morellic migration into the area; they were made obsolete following their merging into the Ováurmith tribe. They lived in and created settlements built on rivers on the east edge of the snixian mountain range.

### Reputation
The Ilorrų́nolith were largely unknown to the other tribes on account of their isolation in the south; but to the little tribes that knew of them, they were seen as simple, dumb, and quaint, but very good at animal husbandry. They largely neglected to fight against oppressors, leading to their incorporation into the Ováurmith tribe.

### Relationships
### Snissoj
The Ilorrų́nolith were known to the [Sëniksol](lore/c1BD/sëniksol-tribe.md) tribe, who largely ignored them apart from in trade. The Ilorrų́nolith inhabited an area outside of the Sëniksolan habitat, and posed no threat to them in that regard. They were involved in a lot of trade with the Sëniksol, creating a pidgin language for trade with the people as time went on.

### Culture
The Ilorrų́nolith tribe had a very animist culture; worshipping trees, rivers, and [pebble spires](phenomena/pebble-spires.md), which they saw to be the source of goodness and blessing. They were one of the first tribes to develop music, and fashioned flutes out of stone which they would play by using alucinara energy to flow air through their pipes and holes.
