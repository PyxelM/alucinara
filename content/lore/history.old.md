## Timekeeping
The Abbreviation EA stands for 'Event After.' It refers to any event after the fall of the Oyhóyunol empire. The opposite abbreviation is BD, standing for 'Before Destruction.'

## 1st Century BD
The 1st century BD ended with the breaking off of the [*Moráillona*](cultures/morellic.md)[^1] family from the larger [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md)[^2] tribe, which was destroyed, into the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe.

### The Oyhóyunol Empire
The Oyhóyunol tribe was spearheaded by the [Motúdjas](lore/c1bd/families/motudjas-family.md)[^3] dynasty, ruled by a pair of deformed twin sisters, Nghoiyúma and Djatúsa[^4]. The twins were based in the city of [Náiru](locations/nairu.md)[^5], the capitol of the Oyhóyunol empire, which spanned from the eastern coast of the central continent through to the border of the [Rwaránehru](lore/c1bd/rwaranehru-tribe.md)[^6] tribe and their equatorial lakes.

### The Fall of Oyhóyunol
Due to the twinship of Nghoiyúma and Djatúsa, they shared one soul, and once Nghoiyúma was murdered by her armour-bearer for power, Djatúsa was overcome with magic; her one body now held the [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md) energy of two.

This drove Djatúsa mad, and her lifespan, insanity, and strength were augmented by twice as much as before. She began to make irrational decisions, and her city's stability and economy was deeply affected.

Eventually, in desparation, a lot of the citizens of Náiru began to turn to crime, stealing food just to survive. This dramatically increased the crime level, and also increased the amount of soulless in the population, as tail removal was a common punishment for theft (although most criminals were simply executed).

#### Gesímhurën's Brother
Now there was a minikin named Ëbyámra[^7], brother of a minikin named Gesímhurën[^8], both of the Farmer family of Moráillona. The house of Moráillona was very spiritual, and each member was raised in an environment where they learned of how to interface with [the deities](deities/deities.md), [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), and [laws of the universe](phenomena/natural-laws.md).

Ëbyámra had stolen a lot of fruit from another farmer, as his harvest had run dry. In fact, he had taken every fruit from one of the farmer's trees; a crime of theft. Ëbyámra knew the risks, but decided to steal regardless, as his wife had just given birth to a litter which they couldn't afford to feed.

This was immediately reported upon discovery, and it didn't take long for the Náiruan guards to sniff out Ëbyámra's scent upon the tree, among other blatant pieces of evidence such as torn clothes on branches.

#### His Execution
The trial was swift and unfair, despite the correctness of the guilty verdict. Djatúsa interfered to take express control, taking great joy in the torture and execution of Ëbyámra for what she percieved to be *'a horrid corruption of the purity of her great city.'* His death was characterised by a flagrant exercise of violence, suffering made manifest by [the crystal](phenomena/alucinara.md)'s influence on the Queen.
 
The entire Moráillona family was distraught at the loss; it was even worse that they couldn't openly perform the traditional grieving rituals for fear of disfigurement, torture, or punishment by the queen who took him for the *betterment of the city*.

One ambitious member of the family named Gesímhurën, Ëbyámra's sister, felt like she couldn't let this be it; she couldn't let her brother lie in a pit of gemstones with other cursed souls 4 lengths under the surface. She had to do something.

#### The Plan
Using her knowledge of [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md), she made a plan to bring vengeance and true justice to Djatúsa. She would create an extensive system of [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md) in and around the Royal Tree of Náiru, so that [The Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) might see the evil of the queen and her servants and destroy them.

She performed this plan with her cousin, Nghoyúri[^9]. Nghoyúri carved eyes into pebbles, Gesímhurën carved eyes into the bark of the tree and the clay of the shelters, and both of them placed the pebbles that Nghoyúri had made about the tree.

In order to appear innocuous, they pretended to be Soulless, merely servants cleaning the walkways and ornaments with their tails shaven and tucked away as to appear amputated, despite how embarassing it would be, and how it would affect how they were treated, to appear so lowly.

#### The Aftermath
The destruction of the queen and her servants was a success, but many innocent people were also affected in a tragic play of events. The night after the plan unfolded, as Gesímhurën slept, a baby meadow was created in the royal tree.

The result was that the royal offices of Náiru were rendered unusable, as the baby sludge would surely blight anyone who stepped in it. Djatúsa was killed, likewise for her servants - all but a small group of Nobles who were out on an diplomatic campaign.

Náiru was thrown into chaos, with no queen and no forseeable heir, the Motúdjas dynasty was destroyed in but a night, and there was no centre of power to stablise the guards and citizenship. This led to the swift fall of the Oyhóyunol tribe and its empire.

## 1st Century EA
Many groups arose from the ashes of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe, especially the [Moráillona](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md) family. The destruction of Oyhóyunol ended the suppression of many of their former citizens, allowing many lowly families to gain more power, fight for control, and win it.

Many groups rose following the fall of the Oyhóyunol tribe, including but not limited to;
- [The Morellic Tribe](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md);
- [The 'Akempali Tribe](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md);
- [The Ǫzí Tribe](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md);
- [The Ovaurmith Tribe](lore/c1ea/ovaurmith-tribe.md);
- And [The Snissol Tribe](lore/c1ea/snissol-tribe.md).
