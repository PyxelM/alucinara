## Overview
%%Sarvara was founded by the Mora clan of the nomadic [Early Morellic Tribes](pre/early-morellic-tribes.md), who migrated into the Sarvaran river basin from the northeastern steppes. They mostly integrated into the native, sedentary cultures, most notably the Diiran minikin, from whom they gained the name for their holy river - the river Sarav[^1].

The founding of the city soon preceded the Minikin Copper Age, also known as the Chalcolithic, a period of time where the Sarvaran city state and it's territories gained a foothold in the river basin through trade and war.

The [Sarvaran Golden Age](lore/sarvaran-golden-age.md), which began at the dawn of the Bronze Age, was a period of time spanning up to 500 years in which the city prospered and its culture was enriched with poetry, pottery, art, technology, and religion.

Despite this prosperity, Sarvara was not destined to last. The end of the Sarvaran Golden Age was heralded by the emergence of the Sarvaran Plague, an illness that ravaged the Sarvaran city state and the urban environments in its territory. The city was lost.

The only people to survive were those residing within the rural settlements of the Sarvaran territory. These groups were disparate, and unorganised, and a period known as the Sarvaran Dark Ages was marked by bloodshed as the warring post-Sarvaran city states fought one another to survive and thrive.

Eventually, however, a [Corothic](lore/2nd-realm/coroth.md) military general known as The Elephant arose from the ashes of Sarvara as a phoenix and united the disparate post-Sarvaran city states, and more, into what would eventually become the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child.md).%%
