## Overview
Tseireph is a continent of the planet Qherelh in the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). It is notable for being the source of the Morellic Minikin, and the place where civilisation emerged[^1]. It is essentially split in half, between north and south Tseireph, divided by the equatorial rainforest, and nethic lakes.
## Geography
Tseireph is large, spanning across multiple continental plates. It has two saltwater lakes on the equator, around which are a surrounding rainforest with monsoon coasts, and to the east are a large gulf and a rainforest-monsoon peninsula; to the south are a desert, steppe, mediterranean climate, continental climate, mountains, and a southeastern peninsula; and to the north are a desert, a steppe, and tundral mountains by the coast.
