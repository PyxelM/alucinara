## Overview
Coroth was a Morellic city state and civilisation founded in the Neolithic Era. The land of Coroth was situated in the continental forests of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md), to the east of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md). Coroth would go on to be succeeded by the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/empire-of-the-petrified-child).
## History
Coroth was founded in the late Neolithic period (between 5,700 - 3,200 BS[^1]) by the eponymous [early Morellic](lore/2nd-realm/early-morellic-tribes.md) tribe known at the time as the 'Kyuludh,' or 'blue-eyed,' named for the mutation in blue eye colour seen in the tribe's membership.

After the [Fall of Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/fall-of-sarvara), Coroth would go on to become the greatest power then-seen in all of Tseireph. With the advent of the iron age, a Corothic general known as The Elephant (or Elephant I) would found the Empire of the Petrified Child, annexing the remnants of the Sarvaran empire.
## Exports
Coroth's main export was Corothic blue, a pigment used in artwork and dyeing, which was extracted from the native [Water Dragons](fauna/dragons.md) of the river Coroth, a tributary of the river Sarav. Coroth also pioneered the agriculture and trade of fruits and berries, contrasting Sarvara's industry of Lunuth Wheat, and Aqhor's of Sweetrice.
