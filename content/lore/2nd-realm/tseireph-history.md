## Overview
[Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md) is a continent of the planet of [Kherelh](lore/2nd-realm/Kherelh.md) in the Cadra solar system of the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). The continent is home to many lands, cultures, and species, such as the [minikin](fauna/minikin.md). It was formed millions of years ago, when tectonic plates converged and diverged into the landmass known in the present.
## Early History
### Paleolithic - Mesolithic Eras
Intelligent life appeared on the continent with the beginning of the Paleolithic era, or old Stone age, when squirrels developed into early Minikin. These Minikin would begin to create tools using stone and wood, use spoken language to share ideas and information, and cast spells using [Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md). It was around this time the first religions formed, generally polytheistic or pantheistic forms of animism or zoolatry.

Alucinara allowed the thence insentient minikin to evolve cognitively and physically into more anthropoid creatures, capable of using magic to create fire, manipulate objects in otherwise impossible ways, and interact with [deities](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md). This aided the Minikin invaluably in gaining sentience as previously small, feeble prey animals.
### Neolithic Era
The neolithic revolution spelled the beginning of the new Stone age, when the [Diira](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/diira.md) tribe began to cultivate and domesticate the wild plants they had fed upon for thousands of years, and places of seasonal harvest became early farms.

> [!info]
> The Diira were a tribe of Nethic semi-nomadic proto-agriculturalists native to the Sarvaran River Basin, south of the [Jana](lore/2nd-realm/jana-mountains.md) mountains. They founded the settlements that would precede Sarvara and Belonara.
#### Farms and Cities
The development of these farms led to the creation of nearby temporary dwellings, where farmers and their families could rest and goods could be stored and traded. These became the first settlements, towns, and villages, where semi-nomadic or even sedentary communities would live for some or all of the year.

These settlements faced abandonment from many factors, such as drought, famine, disease, and conflict. However, some clung on, owing to the advantages they may have had over other settlements, and expanded into the first proto-cities and early city-states.
#### Conflict
The first recorded conflict in the region of Southern Tseireph was between the [Naharsi](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/naharsi*.md) and [Mora](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/mora*.,d) tribes, after a famine had forced the former into forming war parties to raid, attack, and pillage the neighbouring communities for resources and fertile land.

> [!info]
> The Naharsi were another Nethic group of proto-agriculturalist nomads native to the southwestern coast of Tseireph, and the Mora were a Morellic group of semi-nomadic pastoralists native to the steppe south of the equator.

The conflict ultimately ended in a Naharsi victory. The Mora were stripped of their posessions, taken as slaves, and the rest driven out of their homeland. This triggered a migration southward over the [Jana](lore/2nd-realm/jana-mountains.md) mountains, which would result in the spread of Morellic groups across southern Tseireph.
#### Morellic Migration
The migration split the Mora into many individual tribes, each settling in differing regions. This led the Morellic tribes to gave a great degree of genetic admixture and cultural interaction with their neighbouring groups, laying the foundation for trade, war, and peace.

The Sarvarans descended from the Mora who settled in the Sarvaran River Basin, with some substrate ancestry from the Diirans, owing them light brown skin andh hairier fur distribution, with a caste system partly inherited from the Diira dividing the people into untouchables, commoners, low nobles, high nobles, and genderless priests. The Sarvarans became pastoral farmers, trading mostly vegetables, fruit, livestock, meat, wool, clothing, and [watchstones](phenomena/watchstones.md).

The Coroths descended from the Mora who migrated eastward into the continental forests. They came into contact with the native Huau minikin, gaining a lighter skin tone but more hair, and split into the North and South Corothic tribes. They became arboreal foragers and fishermen, trading mostly fruit, fish, dyes, and clothing.

Furthermore, the Aqhorans descended from those who settled in the southern, coastal, wetland delta region. They came into contact with the Thaneyan minikin of the islands off the coast and the southwestern continent, and became a warlike people of seafarers, trading mostly fish, boating equipment, and weapons.
#### Conflict
The settling of the Mora in the Sarvaran basin was met with unnease by the native Diira, and the Mora - hearing a language similar to those who had turned their way of life upside-down - were likewise uneasy about the people they had found themselves up against.

The relationship between the early Sarvarans and the Diira was shaky, wobbling between war and relative peace. Almost immediately a trade relationship was established between the common people of each tribe, but the rulers and nobles were unready to see the benefits from one another.

The conflict between the two factions came to a head when a party of Diirans had destroyed the peripheral Sarvaran settlement of Sabelin[^3], pillaging the village's resources and taking the survivors - mostly children - as slaves. The Diirans saw it as an opportunity to take back land that should have been theirs, claiming divine right, despite the move being undeniably risky, preemptive, and impulsive.

This triggered the first Sarvaran-Diiran war. %% write more on this... %%
### The Bronze Age
The Bronze Age was heralded by advancements in metallurgy, especially by northern Sarvarans who combined the copper and tin of the Jana mountains to create the alloy that would define the era, stronger than any material seen before on Kherelh.
