## Overview
Tseireph is a continent of the planet of [Kherell](lore/2nd-realm/kherell.md) in the Cadra solar system of the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). The continent is home to many lands, cultures, and species, such as the [minikin](fauna/minikin.md). It was formed millions of years ago, when tectonic plates converged and diverged into the landmass known in the present.
## Early History
Intelligent life appeared on the continent with the beginning of the Paleolithic period, when squirrels developed into early Minikin. These Minikin would begin to create tools using stone and wood, use spoken language to share ideas and information, and cast spells using [Alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md). It was around this time the first religions formed, generally polytheistic or pantheistic forms of animism or zoolatry.

Alucinara allowed the thence insentient minikin to evolve cognitively and physically into more anthropoid creatures, capable of using magic to create fire, manipulate objects in otherwise impossible ways, and interact with [deities](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md). This aided the Minikin invaluably in gaining sentience as previously small, feeble prey animals.
