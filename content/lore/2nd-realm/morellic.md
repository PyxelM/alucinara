## Overview
The Morellic minikin are an ethnic group of [minikin](private/trash/fauna/minikin.md) native to southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). They originated in the areas north of the Jana mountain range, but would eventually migrate southward. They would go on to found civilisations such as [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md), [Aqhor](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/aqhor.md), [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/coroth.md), and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md).
## Appearance
The Proto-Morellic minikin were around 27.5cm tall on average, with brown skin, dark fur, and green eyes. They had minimal fur growth, lacking hair on their arms, legs, and nose. Their descendents would eventually develop differing appearances.
