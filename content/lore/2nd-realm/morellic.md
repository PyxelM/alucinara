## Overview
The Morellic minikin are an ethnic group of [minikin](private/trash/fauna/minikin.md) native to southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). They originated in the areas north of the Jana mountain range, but would eventually migrate southward. They would go on to found civilisations such as [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara*.md), [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/coroth.md), and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md).
## Appearance
The Proto-Morellic minikin were around 27.5cm tall on average, with brown skin, dark fur, and green eyes. They had minimal fur growth, lacking hair on their arms, legs, and nose. Their descendents would eventually develop differing appearances.
## Morellic Tribes
### Mora
The Mora, for which the ethnicity is named, were a neolithic tribe of Morellic minikin native to the desert and steppes of southern Tseireph. They lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and were among the first to develop the practice of pastoralism, spreading it throughout their future territory.

Eventually, they were driven out of the steppes, over the Jana mountains to the south, following attacks from the [Asri](lore/2nd-realm/neth/asri.md) tribe in search of resources and land. They would go on to settle in the southern and southwestern regions.
### Sarvaran
The Sarvaran minikin were a successor tribe of the Mora following the end of the neolithic period. They settled in the eponymous Sarvaran River Basin, eliminating the [Diira](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/diira.md) from the region. They eventually founded [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara*.md), a city-state, civilisation, and empire which would go on to become the most prominent and technologically innovative nation of the Bronze Age.
### Coroth
Coroth was another successor tribe of the Mora. Rather than migrating into the Sarvaran River Basin, they rather split during the migration and settled in the continental forests of the Southwest. They would go on to pick up the mantle of Sarvara, founding the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md), the most prominent empire of the Iron age.
