## Overview
The Diira were a [Nethic](lore/2nd-realm/nethic.md) tribe of [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) native to the Sarvaran River Basin in southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md), in the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md) during the neolithic period. They were responsible for the spread of agriculture and the admixture of Nethic ancestry throughout the continent.
## The Neolithic Revolution
The neolithic revolution began as the Diira began to transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of agriculture and organised religion.
### Beginnings of Agriculture
At first, they simply foraged and hunted for wild plants and animals, but as time went on they began to take a more active role in the reproductive cycle of the plants they consumed. They would collect the seeds of plants, planting them in areas they could rely upon for fertility and ease of access; in other words, in proto-farms.

As time went on, they began to artificially select certain strains of the plants they consumed, resulting in larger, more nutritious cultivars. This is the first instance of domestication among the groups of southern Tseireph. Ultimately, the Diira domesticated the many founder crops of southern Tseireph, such as [Lunuth](flora/lunuth.md) and [Pelen](flora/pelen.md).
### Founding of Settlements
The development of farming led the Diiran minikin to settle down in villages built beside the proto-farms they had created, generally beside rivers and other places where soil was fertile enough to sustain a whole village.

Diiran villages were generally built out of mud or clay, stones, and wood. They were made up of uncomplex houses and public areas that both spanned not only the ground but also up into the trees, where the Minikin would spend their time relaxing or sleeping.
### Religion
The Diiran religion was polytheistic, worshipping the [Angels](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md) and the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md). The Diiran minikin would build grand temples, such as the one in [Kaúla Sabélina](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/diira/sabelina.md), leading pilgrimages to become more and more common and the religion to take greater importance in Diiran life.
### Spread of Agriculture
Agriculture, having been invented by Diira in the area, spread as the group began to proliferate and seek out further locations to farm as their populations increased. Eventually, the Diiran minikin would admix into, conflict with, and assimilate further people groups, leading to the widespread adoption of farming across southern Tseireph.
## Fall
The fall of the Diiran people as a distinct tribal nation would occur by the late neolithic period, when the [Sarvaran](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md) minikin would invade the south as they were driven out of the northern steppes by the [Asri](lore/2nd-realm/nethic/asri*.md) tribe. Ultimately, the Diiran minikin were eliminated by the Sarvarans, who decimated the tribe's population and assimilated the rest.
