## Overview
*Kaúla Sabélina*[^1] was a neolithic settlement inhabited by the Diiran minikin, and one of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md)'s first proto-cities. It was a large settlement built around a temple, and was an important religious site in the Diiran religion.
## Location
Sabelina was more susceptible to magic anomalies, stemming from a greater intensity of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) in the area. When the settlement was first built on the site by the neolithic Diiran minikin, it quickly grew in religious importance as many would have religious experiences there. Eventually, a grand temple would be built, and the settlement augmented into a proto-city around it.
## The Temple
The Temple of Sabelina became the centre of the Diiran religion during the neolithic period. It was here that sacrifices would be made to the Diiran [gods](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md), and many Diiran pilgrims would travel from their hometowns to the settlement on holy days.
