## Overview
*Kaúla Sabélina*[^1] was a neolithic settlement inhabited by the Diiran minikin, and one of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md)'s first proto-cities. It was a large settlement built around a temple, and was an important religious site in the Diiran religion.
## Location
Sabelina was more susceptible to magic anomalies, stemming from a greater intensity of [alucinara](lore/cosmology/alucinara.md) in the area. When the settlement was first built on the site by the neolithic Diiran minikin, it quickly grew in religious importance as many would have religious experiences there. Eventually, a grand temple would be built, and the settlement augmented into a proto-city around it.
## The Temple
The Temple of Sabelina became the centre of the Diiran religion during the neolithic period. It was here that sacrifices would be made to the Diiran [gods](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-angels.md), and many Diiran pilgrims would travel from their hometowns to the settlement for holidays such as the solstices.
## Fall
Sabelina would eventually fall alongside the Diiran people due to invasions from the [Morellic](lore/2nd-realm/morellic.md) minikin near the end of the neolithic era. The settlement and its temple were eventually buried over time, and ultimately forgotten.

However, the alucinara intensity did not change. Despite the temple of Sabelina being forgotten, the area would continue to be an area of religious importance to many cultures such as [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara*.md) and the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md).
