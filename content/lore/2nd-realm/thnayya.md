## Overview
Thnayya was a prehistoric civilisation of [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) in the [2nd realm](lore/2nd-realm.md). It was located in south [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md), in a time when the sea levels were lower, and is now located in the Aqhoran strait off the coast of the Sarvaran river basin. They are known for their extinction due to rising sea levels.
## Origins
The Thnayyan minikin originated from the Proto-Thnayyo-Nethic group of ancient hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the lands of southwest [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). The Thnayyans eventually migrated south to what is now the Aqhoran strait, and the Nethic minikin north to the equatorial lakes.
## Achievements
The Thnayyans were among the first civilisations to prosper, mastering many art forms from pottery, to architecture, to agriculture, and to writing.
### Thnayyan Script
The Thnayyan script was a logographic writing system which was chiselled into stone. The ruins of Thnayya are littered with stone-carved heiroglyphics, which many future historians would eventually try and fail to interpret.
## Fall
Eventually, the knowledge, language, and wealth of Thnayyan was lost after a time of glacial melting that led the sea levels to rise, shortly before the Aqhorans migrated from the southwestern continent and the Sarvaran bronze age began.
## Remnants
The remnants of Thnayya are found in Thnayyo-Nethic admixture into the genetics of Aqhor, the underwater ruins off the coast of the Sarvaran river basin, and both Aqhoran and Morellic folklore tracing back to Thnayyan culture.

A rich culture of treasure hunting among Aqhoran seafarers eventually emerged as Thnayyan ruins began to be discovered, explored, and plundered for their artefacts, resources, and value.
