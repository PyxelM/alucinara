## Overview
The Empire of the Petrified Child (adj. 'Stonechild Imperial') was the successor state to [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) and [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/coroth.md), situated in [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md), encompassing the central and eastern areas of the south. It was founded at the dawn of the Iron Age after the Sarvaran Plague, circa 2,000 AS. The Empire followed a monotheistic religion which involved the worship of the eponymous [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md).
## Political System
The political system of the empire was that of an oligarchical theocracy. 'High Matriarch / Patriarch' was the title given to the elected leader[^1] among the oligarchy, who each ruled the state equally in a system of democracy. The head of the state was also synonymous with head of the church, as the empire leaned more toward a theocracy, seeking the guidance of their deity in their decisions.
## History
The Empire was founded following the Sarvaran Plague, which decimated the population of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara.md) and led to the civilisation's fall. Coroth, a related Morellic nation, annexed the remaining territories of Sarvara and led an offensive against [Aqhor](lore/2nd-realm/aqhor.md) in the south, whom attacked Sarvara for resources following the plague.

With the annexation of Sarvara, a Corothic military group emerged victorious over Aqhor. It was this group that would go on to found the empire, forming a coup d'etat against the government of Coroth due to their political differences. The newly-formed empire then elected a general known as 'The Elephant' (or Elephant I) as their first High Patriarch.

During the empire's existence, an emphasis grew on religion, and the Stonechild Religion developed. This religion was monotheistic, with the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md) held as 'God.' The office of High Matriarch evolved to encompas the church, and the empire evolved more and more into a theocracy.

Ultimately, it was by the empire's hand that the Petrified Child was imprisoned within the [-3rd realm](lore/-3rd-realm.md) following the failed construction of the Temple of the Petrified Child, within which the deity itself was intended to be contained for worship. This failure led to the fall of the empire, when the Petrified Child destroyed the nation's populus in an extinction event that turned the empire into the largest Baby Meadow seen in recorded history. The empire lasted 2,000 years before it fell c. 4,000 AS.
