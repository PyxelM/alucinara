## Overview
Coroth was a Bronze-Age Morellic city located in the continental forests of southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). It was noteable for the cultural influence it took from the neighbouring, non-morellic tribes, and for the export of Corothic Blue - a pigment derived from [water dragons](fauna/dragons.md).
