## Overview
The Empire of the Petrified Child (adj. 'Stonechild Imperial') was the successor state to [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara*.md) and [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/coroth.md), situated in [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md), encompassing the central and eastern areas of the south. It was founded at the dawn of the Iron Age after the Sarvaran Plague, circa 2,000 AS. The Empire followed a monotheistic religion which involved the worship of the eponymous [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md).
## Political System
The political system of the empire was that of an oligarchical theocracy. 'High Matriarch / Patriarch' was the title given to the elected leader[^1] among the oligarchy, who each ruled the state equally in a system of democracy. The head of the state was also synonymous with head of the church, as the empire leaned more toward a theocracy, seeking the guidance of their deity in their decisions.
