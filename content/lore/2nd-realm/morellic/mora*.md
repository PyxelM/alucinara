## Overview
The Mora were a neolithic tribe of hunter-gatherer [minikin](fauna/minikin.md) native to Southern [Tseireph](lore/2nd-realm/tseireph.md). They spoke a language reconstructed as Proto-Morellic, and were the ancestors of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara.md), [Coroth](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/coroth.md), and [Aqhor](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/aqhor*.md).
