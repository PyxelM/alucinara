## Overview
The Sarvaran calendar was the official calendar of the Sarvaran empire, and was used in most parts of the Sarvaran river basin during the empire's tenure in the Bronze age. It was adopted in the 210th year of the 1st Sarvaran Dynasty, and lasted until the [Fall of Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/sarvara/fall-of-sarvara.md). The calendar that followed it was the Stonechild Imperial Calendar.
## Description
The Sarvaran calendar is a lunisolar calendar with 8 months of 34 days, with two leap days, adding up to 272-274 days. The months follow the orbit of [Kherell](lore/2nd-realm/kherell.md)'s largest moon, Ena, and the year begins on the spring equinox - symbolising rebirth.
### Leap Days
The orbital period of Kherell is exactly 272.25 days, and Ena's orbital period is exactly 34.05625 days. As these numbers are not whole, there are two leap days inserted every few years. The first leap day occurs at the end of the 1st month, repeating every 5 years, and the second leap day takes place at the end of the 5th month, repeating every 4 years.

## Origins
The Sarvaran calendar was adopted in the 210th year of the 1st Sarvaran Dynasty, created by a monk known only as Oleander[^1]. Not much is known about Oleander, but the high matriarch at the time was Coriandra IV.
