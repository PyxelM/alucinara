## Overview
The term 'High Matriarch' (sometimes 'High Patriarch') is the name given to the rulers of [Sarvara](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/sarvara*.md) and some other nations, especially the [Empire of the Petrified Child](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/stonechild.md) and within the wider Morellic sphere of influence. The position has its roots in the matrilineal clan system of the [Early Morellic Tribes](lore/2nd-realm/morellic/early-morellic-tribes.md). The first high matriarch of Sarvara was Coriandra I, and the first high patriarch of the Empire of the Petrified Child was Elephant I.
