## Overview
Sarvara was a river and later became the name of an imperial Morellic civilisation. The name is taken from the Sarvaran language, meaning 'our river.' The region of the Sarvaran river basin was home to many peoples, such as the Aqhoran and Morellic minikin, and became a hotspot for political activity and trade.

In the north of the river basin was the Sarvaran highlands, an area of high altitude in the mountains. In the highlands, several glacial lakes had formed, such as lake Jerrun, which the river Sarvara flowed from.
