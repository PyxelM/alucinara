The history of the Morellic [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) is long, beginning with the Mora tribe.
## The Mora Tribe
The Mora were a tribe of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md), subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.

By their peak, the Mora held 6 clans of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these clans was the Senna, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.
## The Senna Clan
The Senna, led by a matriarch known as Deerweed, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.

The largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the Mora; a city known as Endáirų, meaning 'city of farms,' built upon the annually-flooding river Úrų̈cás, meaning 'river of the east,' in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.
## The Senna Civil War
The stability of the Senna was thrown into question, however, upon the civil war. Triggered by a succession crisis between Deerweed's daughters, the elder Fern and the younger Mint, which ended in the latter's assassination, a new clan split off; the Lantana.
## The Battle over the Úrų̈cás
The Lantana, led by Deerweed's eldest niece Wirilda, fought with the Senna, led by Fern, over matriarchal power. This led to the Battle of Úrų̈cás. The Senna were flanked from the west by the Lantana military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.

The battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of Senna minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lantana victorious, the Senna were defeated, but the battle left Endáirų inhospitable, run-down, and littered with [Baby Meadows](deities/the-petrified-child.md).

## Proliferation of the Northeast
While the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river Úrų̈cás caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lantana's part.

Having received prophecy of a famine, Wirilda made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lantana and Senna, to the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.

This was a success, initially; the Lantana built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of Endáirų to the west, known as Endáirų múKrefír, meaning 'New Endáirų.' There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other Mora clans moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.

In addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the Mora minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Oyholïru.
## The Famine
Despite the Lantana's efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from [The Mother Tree](deities/mother-tree.md) to punish the Lantana for preparing with such violence.

The total population of the Mora halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. New Endáirų became known as Ánnakháirų, meaning 'the city of souls.'

The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving Senna minikin attempted to take over the Lantana once more. This began with the battle of New Endáirų.
## Ankewenith and the Asvatha
Following the loss over the Úrų̈cás, the surviving Senna, known as the Ankewenith, fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lantana and sympathetic Mora in the neighbouring nation of the Asvatha tribe to the west.

Motivated by racism and jealousy, the Asvatha, led by the patriarch Erebo'u and his vizier Olwana (Wirilda's daughter, the new Ankewenith matriarch), passed east over the river Kohosh to fight the Lantana.
## The Weakening of the Lantana
The Asvatha didn't take to raiding cities such as New Endáirų, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lantana's territory. These settlements were the nation's main source of food, especially those built on the Úrų̈cás.

The Asvatha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lantana farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lantana, and made them dependent on the hostile Asvatha for the little food in the area left.
