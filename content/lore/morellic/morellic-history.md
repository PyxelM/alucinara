The history of the Morellic [minikin](species/fauna/minikin.md) is long, beginning with the Móra tribe.
## The Móra Tribe
The Móra were a tribe of minikin with fair skin and thick fur on their extremities. They spoke Proto-Morellic and lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the humid continental climate of northern [Tseiréph](lore/locations/tseireph.md), subsisting upon bugs, berries, leaves, and small mammals as livestock.

By their peak, the Móra held 6 clans of 50-150 minikin. The largest of these clans was the Sénna, which inhabited the eastern coast of the north. Their speciality was agriculture, as they were the only group to consistently farm in the whole north.
## The Sénna Clan
The Sénna, led by a matriarch known as Dírwîdh, had many farms across the northeast. They would travel from one farming location to another, foraging and replanting plants, before moving on once the land had been exhausted.

The largest farm eventually grew to be the largest settlement of the Móra; a city known as Endáirų, meaning 'city of farms,' built upon the annually-flooding river Úrų̈cás, meaning 'river of the east,' in a patch of Mediterranean climate. This city became a hub of trade, one of the most economically prosperous cities in the northeast.
## The Sénna Civil War
The stability of the Sénna was thrown into question, however, upon the civil war. Triggered by a succession crisis between Dírwîdh's daughters, the elder Hwérna and the younger Móth, which ended in the latter's assassination, a new clan split off; the Lantána.
## The Battle over the Úrų̈cás
The Lantána, led by Dírwîdh's eldest niece Wírridh, fought with the Sénna, led by Hwérna, over matriarchal power. This led to the Battle of Úrų̈cás. The Sénna were flanked from the west by the Lantána military, from the north by the inhospitable tundra, and from the south and east by the river and sea.

The battle caused great casualties from both sides, a great majority of Sénna minikin succumbing to attacks in the swampy mud of the riverbanks. The Lantána victorious, the Sénna were defeated, but the battle left Endáirų inhospitable, run-down, and littered with [Baby Meadows](deities/the-petrified-child.md).

## Proliferation of the Northeast
While the battle caused great tragedy, the baby sludge that flowed through the river Úrų̈cás caused the many banks and swamps downstream to proliferate into baby meadows. This was partly a strategic point on the Lantána's part.

Having received prophecy of a famine, Wírridh made an effort to sacrifice soldiers, both Lantána and Sénna, to the [Petrified Child](deities/the-petrified-child.md) so that the fertility of the land around them may increase.

This was a success, initially; the Lantána built a new settlement more inland and downstream from the ruins of Endáirų to the west, known as Endáirų múKrefír, meaning 'New Endáirų.' There, berries and fruit were abundant in the debuted jungle, and many of the other Móra clans moved in, forsaking their nomadic lifestyles.

In addition, diplomacy was prosperous, and the Móra minikin grew friendly with neighbouring tribes such as the Oyhólïru.
## The Famine
Despite the Lantána's efforts, the tides of fate rolled in, and the famine came after a decade of prosper. The produce of the trees grew sour; a direct effort from [The Mother Tree](deities/mother-tree.md) to punish the Lantána for preparing with such violence.

The total population of the Móra halved as the famine took over the north, and morale was low. New Endáirų became known as Ánnakháirų, meaning 'the city of souls.'

The climate grew cold, the soil infertile, and political tension was rife. It was at this point that the surviving Sénna minikin attempted to take over the Lantána once more.
## Ankewenith and the Avétha
Following the loss over the Úrų̈cás, the surviving Sénna, known as the Ankewenith, fled to begin sowing seeds of hatred and discrimination against the Lantána and sympathetic Móra in the neighbouring nation of the Avétha tribe to the west.

Motivated by racism and jealousy, the Avétha, led by the patriarch Erebó'u and his vizier Orwána (Hwérna's daughter, the new Ankewenith matriarch), passed east over the river Kóhosh to fight the Lantána.
## The Weakening of the Lantána
The Avétha didn't take to raiding cities such as Ánnakháirų, but rather began to attack the outskirts the Lantána's territory. These settlements were the nation's main source of food, especially those built on the Úrų̈cás.

The Avétha, taking over these settlements, began to over-tax the Lantána farmers and control trade in, out and through the nation. This greatly weakened the Lantána, and made them dependent on the hostile Avétha for the little food in the area left.
## Orwána's Plans
Unbeknownst to Erebó'u, his vizier Orwána was rounding the Sénna and their mercenaries against the Lantána, with the intent to attack Ánnakháirų and genocide the Lantána in their weakened state.

While the Avétha were concerned with oppressing and virtually enslaving the Lantána, the Sénna were concerned with complete annihilation - a prospect unappealing to the Avétha.

This was discovered by the Lantána-sympathetic supreme priest of the Avétha, Rwénedh the Blind, whom was 1 quarter Lantána. He, in secret, told the Lantána matriarch Wírridh II (daughter of the previous) of the Sénna's plans.
## Lantána-Oyhólïru League
Upon hearing of this, the Lantána proposed a military alliance with the Oyhólïru in order to fight the Sénna upon the dawn of their genocidal campaign.
