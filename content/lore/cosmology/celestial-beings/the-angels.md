## Overview
The Angels are celestial beings created by the [Judges](lore/cosmology/the-judges.md) to govern the different elements of the original creation, which reside in the dreamscape. They are worshipped in many polytheistic religions, affording rewards to those who worship them, requiring worship, prayer, and sacrifice in return for good favour, luck, and prosperity.

Some Angels are good, aligning with the moral code of the [Petrified Child](lore/cosmology/celestial-beings/the-petrified-child.md). However, they and their devotees are unable to be punished by the deity due to its unwaivering respect and devotion to all things natural and spiritual. Thusly, many angels require evil acts of their devotees, and are known to some as demons.
