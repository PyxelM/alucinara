## Overview
The Morellic tribe, known as Moréillų[^1], was the continuation of the [Moráillona](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md) family after it grew and became larger following the destruction of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe. They spoke a dialect of [Proto-Morellic](lore/c1bd/languages/proto-morellic.md) known as [Old Morellic](lore/c1ea/languages/old-morellic.md).

### Reputation
The reputation of the Morellic tribe varied across cultures. The majority opinion of the morellic tribe was that they were the underdogs which had taken power over their oppressors, a poor tribe that had redeemed itself out of poverty.

This reputation differed to most [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md)-abstaining tribes, such as the 'Akempali, who saw the Morellic tribe as being corrupted by alucinara and destined for collapse on account of their deep relationship with the deities.

### Relationships
#### 'Akempali
The Morellic relationship with the ['Akempali](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md) tribe was defined by disdain. The morellic tribe saw the 'Akempali as a simple terrorist separatist group, a people chasing false ideals and adhering to incomplete truths. They were persecuted by the Morellic tribe, influencing their migration north.

#### Ǫzí
The Morellic relationship with the [Ǫzí](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md) tribe was shaky at best. The morellic people despised the noble ancestry in the population, seeing the Ǫzí nobles as the continuation of the Oyhóyunol tribe which had subjugated them in the past.

However, the morellic people were sympathetic of the Ǫzí natives, drawing parallels between their own oppression and the oppression of the natives. Preceding the fall in the east, the Moráillona family would often trade with the Rwaránehru tribe, this served to provide a foundation for the relationship with the Ǫzí going forward, but a lot of morellic merchants would refuse to serve nobles.

#### Ováurmith


#### Sníssol


### Migration
Due to the fall of [Náiru](locations/nairu.md), it simply wasn't viable to inhabit the area with the anarchy of the uncontrolled citizenship. The morellic tribe, newly formed under the queenship of Pyanéirra[^2], the elder matriarch of the Moráillona family, was subsequently forced to flee their ancestral homeland.

### Culture
Their culture was founded in the basis of their spiritualism, and a lot of early figures such as Gesímhurën[^3] and Ëbyámra[^4] were mythologised into ancient demi-gods, while figures such as Nghoiyúma, Djatúsa[^5], and Nghoyúri[^6] were mythologised into ancient pawns of evil.

A lot of supernatural entities, living and non-living, would latch onto these cultural figures and give their worship legitimate power. This, compounded with the tribe's oral tradition of sharing information on how to interface with deities, rendered the morellic tribe as a people to be reckoned with.

### The Split
The Moráillona family split into three tribes; the main group, with Pyanéirra at the helm, migrated south over the sarvaran gulf into the lower morellic peninsula. This would continue to be known as the Morellic tribe.

The other two morellic tribes would become to be known as
- [The 'Akempali Tribe](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md);
- and [The Ováurmith Tribe](lore/c1ea/ovaurmith-tribe.md).
