## Overview
The 'Akempali[^1] tribe was the second group to diverge from the [Moráillona](lore/c1bd/families/moraillona-family.md) family. They were spearheaded by the queen Nghoyúri[^2], who had helped Gesímhurën[^3] before. The split was partly motivated by a sense of disgust, as a lot of Moráillona minikin found the fall of the [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) tribe to be cruel and tragic, especially Nghoyúri, who deeply regretted her actions in spite of Gesímhurën's pride. A lot of disgusted separatists joined the 'Akempali.

### Reputation
The 'Akempali were seen as both a brave disadvantaged people, but also a separatist terrorist group who had succeeded from the Morellic tribe. They were persecuted by the Morellic people, and this influenced their migration north.

Apart from their political role, they were a tribe known for their wealth in livestock and food. They traded often with tribes they were on good terms with, and often sold animals in bulk for large amounts of money. This afforded them a reputation of wealth and power over their settled land.

### Relationships
#### Morellic
The 'Akempali's relationship with the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe was defined by hatred and persecution. The tribe persecuted the 'Akempali, and this created a burning disdain for the morellic people. The 'Akempali refused to trade with the morellic people, which greatly angered the tribe as they missed out on an element of the economy that a lot of other tribes were able to enjoy.

#### Ǫzí
The 'Akempali tribe's relationship with the [Ǫzí](lore/c1ea/Ǫzí-tribe.md) tribe was a complicated one; They were unsure of how to treat the Ǫzí nobles, but were on good terms with the natives. They tended to charge the nobles more in trade, as to take advantage of their wealth, and traded freely with the natives.

### Migration
Rather than moving south, the 'Akempali moved north as to take advantage of the wildlife and resources of the area, and to move in the opposite direction of the Morellic tribe which they not only despised but were also persecuted by. They also tended for the eastern coast, constructing port cities mainly with western outposts along rivers.

### Culture
'Akempali culture was defined by a distinct sense of separateness, shown in their isolation from the other two morellic tribes. They differed from them in their departure from spiritualism, being one of the first groups to exhibit [alucinara](phenomena/alucinara.md)-abstainence. They saw alucinara and the deities as a dangerous tool not meant for minikin to wield, and that it was a law of nature that interfering with them would cause tragedy to follow.
