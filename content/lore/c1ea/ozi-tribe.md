## Overview
The Ǫzí[^1] tribe was the result of intermingling and interbreeding of [Oyhóyunol](lore/c1bd/oyhoyunol-tribe.md) nobles on a fruitless diplomatic campaign with the [Rwaránehru](lore/c1bd/rwaranehru-tribe.md) tribe. They were led by a minikin known as Ngudhóro[^2], a noble who had gained power for his ability to manipulate, persuade and convince others. They had a great amount of influence over neighboring tribes.

### Reputation
The Ǫzí tribe had a repution of cunning, deceit, and hoarding of wealth, owing to the Oyhóyunol influence. They were seen as a people who were very good at persuation, blackmail, and pressuring other groups into doing their own bidding.

### Relationships
#### Morellic
The Ǫzí relationship with the [Morellic](lore/c1ea/morellic-tribe.md) tribe was defined by instability, a lot of nobles sought to repair their relationship with the morellic people but this was largely fruitless. The natives were afforded a great amount of freedom in trade, and cemented the Ǫzí people as 'business partners' in the morellic economy.

#### 'Akempali
The Ǫzí natives would commonly trade with the ['Akempali](lore/c1ea/akempali-tribe.md) tribe at fair prices, and the nobles would be expected to pay more for goods on account of their greater wealth and Oyhóyunol ancestry. This afforded a level of disdain that the nobled had for the 'Akempali, seeing the group as nothing more than stubborn.

This was a source of tention between the two Ǫzí castes, as the nobles were jealous of the natives. Regardless, trade in general benefitted both castes as they were one tribe; the relationship the two groups had was not favourable, but they benefitted eachother.

#### Ováurmith


#### Sníssol


### Migration
The Ǫzí tribe inhabited the equatorial lakes, with the natives picking up from the Rwaránehru who had already inhabited the area and the nobles staying in the west following their assignment there and the eventual fall in the east.

### Culture
Ǫzí culture was the continuation of Oyhóyunol culture, although under a different banner due to the restructure of power, and the influence from the Rwaránehru. They developed two castes, Noble and Native. The noble caste was characterised by their presence in power, and the natives were characterised by their gender system and their diminished rights.

In Ǫzí culture, the subjugation of the native caste wasn't seen as a bad thing, but rather the logical continuation of the Rwaránehru. The neuter Rwaránehru worked to lay the philosophical foundation of the Ǫzí, and the Nobles took the foundation and built the new tribe atop it with their wealth and power.
