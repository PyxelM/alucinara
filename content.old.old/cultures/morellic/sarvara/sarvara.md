The Sarvaran Civilisation existed around 7,000YA, and spoke [Sarvaran](private/Z%20content.old/languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran.md).

## Habitat
The Sarvaran Minikin store clay taken from nearby river banks in their cheeks and use this clay in conjunction with reinforcing twigs in order to create their iconic clay shelters.

## Notable People
### Hastini the Elephant
Hastini the Elephant was a Sarvaran general who was known to wear a copper elephant mask over his mouth. This amplified his voice, and led to the depiction that he was taller than his compatriots and even had the head of an elephant himself, although these were exaggerations or erroneous.

### Dhanakai the Sabre-toothed
Dhanakai the Sabre-toothed was a Sarvaran king regarded as a despot. He was known to glue the mouths of dissidents shut with the naturally occurring adhesive of the [Silkvine Plant](private/Z%20content.old/flora/2nd%20realm/oellidirh%20region/silkvine/silkvine.md) and leave them to starve.

### Amkani the Cartographer
Amkani the Cartographer was a Sarvaran cartographer regarded as the father of the [Sarvaran Writing](languages/morellic/sarvaran/sarvaran-logography.md). He would use the [Old Sarvaran](languages/morellic/sarvaran/old-sarvaran.md) logographs in the margins of his maps, but eventually decided to standardise his logographs as to be more organised, but this spread throughout the whole Sarvaran civilisation, military first. The use of Amkani's maps influenced the writing of the many generals, and eventually the common people of the civilisation.
