Ram's Head Migration is the name given to the [Morellic](private/Z%20content.old/cultures/morellic/morellic-culture.md) cultural practice of placing babies in shelters built atop of the antlers of [sheep](private/Z%20content.old/fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/caprines/sheep.md).

It is enacted when the continued settlement of an area would lead to extinction of a group of [Minikin](private/Z%20content.old/fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md).

## How it is performed
Ram's Head Migration is performed by catching a Ram, commonly through the use of paralytic poison that may be delivered through spears or darts.

Two small shelters, akin to [Minikin](private/Z%20content.old/fauna/2nd-realm/mammalia/minikin/minikin.md) houses, are built atop the antlers of the Ram, using the same techniques that are employed to create normal minikin shelters; that is, using dried clay.

Two newborn minikin, unrelated and of different sexes, are then placed within the shelters with a small amount of food and blessings scribbled into the shelter walls.

When the Ram wakes up, the two newborn will be moved across the land while the ram migrates itself.

Unfortunately, Ram's Head Migration commonly leads to the deaths of the children, but it *sometimes* works out, hence its use as a last resort.

## Symbolism
### Grapes
Grapes are commonly used as a symbol for migration, due to their being placed within the Ram's Head Shelters as food for the children.

Grapes are commonly carved into the shelters themselves, as good-luck blessings, but are also carved into temples and houses, as a symbol of fruitfulness.
